INTRODUCTION
25% Anniversary (Fourth) Edition
eo a
quarter century ago I met publisher Michael
Wiese with a crazy idea for a book, distilled
from the theories of mythologist Joseph Campbell and my experiences in critiquing scripts
and novels for Hollywood studios. Wiese, a
tall, soft-spoken documentary filmmaker and visionary, had recently
launched an enterprise in what was called “desktop publishing,” using
the new tools of the computer age to circumvent traditional publishing and create his own line of books to help independent filmmakers
achieve their dreams. That day he listened to my nervous pitch but
was already sold on the idea of a book that made Campbell’s ideas
more accessible to screenwriters and storytellers of all kinds. He called
my bluff, daring me to write this book that I had been thinking and
talking about for years.
While we were both excited by the concept and sure that the
ideas would be useful for creative writers, neither of us expected the
book to be in print for more than one or two seasons, like the vast
majority of books that get published. A few thousand books ought to
be enough to populate the shelves of every screenwriter in the world.
To our continuing surprise, the book caught on and became a
workhorse that found new readers year after year. It got woven into
the storytelling lore of Hollywood and was adopted as a textbook in
Vili
INTRODUCTION TO 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION
cinema and creative writing programs around the world. Screenwriters
were our primary intended audience but the book found users among
novelists, animators, computer game designers, playwrights, actors,
dancers, songwriters, soldiers, travel agents, and social workers. The
twelve-stage journey model was put to work in a wide variety of disciplines such as marketing and product design as a guidance system
that accurately predicts the ups and downs of undertaking anything
difficult. It gives people language and metaphors that help them feel
more in control of their endeavors. Moreover, it has become a part
of many people’s lives, giving them orientation to the grand design of
things and a way to anticipate and cope with challenges.
Now we learn that The Writer's Journey is part of a new branch of
knowledge, heroism science, the study of the heroic pattern and how
it manifests in biology, the arts and human psychology. The founding scholars, among them Drs. Philip Zimbardo, Zeno Franco, Olivia
Efthimiou, Scott T. Allison, and George R. Goethals, are exploring
it in a multidisciplinary way and are tracing its presence as far back
as the primitive cellular level, where some see the heroic cycle in full
operation at the very beginnings of life. It is an optimistic science,
viewing the heroic cycle as an important factor in the evolution of
humanity and a valuable tool in personal life. And the twelve-stage
narrative pattern of The Writer's Journey, along with Campbell's seventeen-stage Hero’s Journey cycle, is one of several templates that
researchers are applying to their study of heroism.
HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED
Obviously, the storytelling environment has evolved in twenty-five
years. For good or bad, hero stories now dominate the world’s narrative entertainment through games and big-budget epic superhero
franchises. It’s not hard to see why. They are easy to understand across
cultures, they often resonate with some aspect of local legend and
myth, and despite their familiarity, they still manage to entrance and
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
please audiences. Their constant presentation of human figures defying death seems to fulfill a deep wish in audiences and they can never
get enough of it.
Heroic stories also serve our collective mental health, by reflecting society and its needs and desires. Mirrored in the struggles and
triumphs of nearly divine superheroes we can see our own battles
magnified, and consider strategies for doing better in the game of
life. Heroic tales influence and help to form society, binding us with
shared cultural references and giving us collective belief systems, codes
of honor, and role models.
However, the superhero movie genre is in danger of becoming
woefully formulaic, and must be continually refreshed with experimentation and willingness to break out of the old story models. To
keep audiences engaged, storytellers must know the age-old patterns
and yet intentionally break them in some way in every composition. A
high standard for this kind of daring was set by the TV series Game of
Thrones, which startled and captivated a huge viewership by demolishing unspoken taboos about the behavior of characters, and by abruptly
killing off beloved heroes who traditionally would be kept alive as the
audience’s representatives until the end of the story. Some members of
the loyal audience were shocked, some turned away completely, feeling betrayed, but many more flocked to it for the pleasure of seeing
what other taboos might be broken. It is my hope that writers will
find in these pages a set of flexible guidelines allowing for that kind
of taboo-busting, rather than a rigid framework, template, or formula
to be mindlessly followed. |
Of course, superhero stories and fantasies are not the only kind
of drama, and I hope that readers will find here guidelines and patterns that can improve intimate stories of human frailty and struggle
as well as stories of epic, titanic scope.
Because of changing technology and new ways of distributing
entertainment, stories are growing longer and shorter at the same
INTRODUCTION TO 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION
time. On one side of the scale, in the current wave of high-quality,
long-form series produced by the likes of HBO, the BBC, Showtime,
the History Channel, and Disney+, the audience has shown a taste
for very long stories that may be driving toward an eventual conclusion, or that, like the Star Wars and Star Trek universes, may never
end. On the other extreme of the narrative spectrum, people seem to
enjoy stories that begin and end in a few minutes or less, and can be
consumed on small smartphone or smartwatch screens.
Although the Hero’s Journey model presented in this volume was
conceived primarily to describe the course of a feature film of ninety
minutes to two hours, it has always been flexible enough to adapt
to super-long or super-short storytelling. Story universes that take
decades to unfold can sustain the attention of the audience with fresh
substories that trace all the stages of a single hero’s journey, while keeping them engaged with a single great dramatic question that makes
the whole composition into a Hero’s Journey for a family, a nation, or
a way of life. And at the other end of the scale, the shortest of short
stories can still resonate with the Hero’s Journey by effectively dramatizing only one or two critical elements of the pattern, such as a hero’s
ordeal, resurrection, or return. After all, in the ancient world they
firmly believed that a single image, embodied by a statue or painted
figures on a vase, could convey the whole essence of a mythic story.
As I look back over twenty-five years of exploring The Writer’
Journey and tracing its effect on mass entertainment, I am encouraged and optimistic. Stories are resilient and seem to be adapting to
a new age and new realities with the help of writers who are always
looking for unexpected ways to put together the elemental pieces.
The audience is adapting too, becoming much more self-aware about
the mechanics of storytelling and moviemaking. This presents both
a challenge and an opportunity: a challenge because the audience
knows all the conventional moves and it’s hard to surprise them or
give them a genuine thrill any more, and an opportunity because if
xi
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
you can surprise them with a totally unexpected story maneuver, they
experience a big rush of pleasure and delight. Also, since the audience
knows the conventional ways of telling a story, you can use a shorthand approach, making quick nods to some turning posts or treating
them ironically, letting the audience feel they are in on the joke.
As you will read in these pages, the hero’s journey is an evergreen
renewal of an ancient pattern that depicts the struggles of characters, be they common people or gods, kings, and superheroes, against
implacable forces of death and destruction. Again and again, going
forward, the ageless battle will be fought. There it is in The Avengers,
Thanos wiping out half the life in the Universe with a snap of his fingers. There it is in Game of Thrones, the Night King leading legions of
resurrected zombies. Death always wins in the end, death is a terrible
opponent, but the stories proclaim that humans are fierce combatants,
too, and sometimes can turn back the forces of destruction for a time,
a glorious time, and stand as heroes.
As a boy growing up on a farm in Missouri, I wondered what stories were and why they so deeply stirred my spirit and expanded my
mind. I set out on a journey to answer those questions and stumbled
onto a source of unexpected power that guided me in a career of story
development in Hollywood and steered me well through life. It is my
sincere hope that you find here something that illuminates your path
and gives you greater enjoyment of the boundless power of stories to
entertain, heal wounded spirits, and change lives.
WHAT'S NEW
So what’s new about this 25th Anniversary Edition?
In recent years, I have been looking more deeply into a way of
thinking about stories as devices for elevating the consciousness of
the audience, or, in the language of the 1960s and ’70s psychedelic
movement, tuning up the audience’s vibrational rate. In a chapter called “It’s All About the Vibes, Man” we explore the concept
INTRODUCTION TO 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION
of chakras from ancient spiritual tradition, suggesting that these
invisible centers of energy can be useful for storytellers, acting as
targets for emotional effects in our tales. They represent a map of
how emotions are experienced in different areas of our bodies. They
show a pathway to higher consciousness and I believe that’s what stories are trying to do, too.
An important issue in storytelling not addressed in earlier editions is the question of “What is a scene?” To fill in that piece of the
tale-spinner’s toolbox, I am borrowing a chapter from my book Memo
from the Story Department: Secrets of Story and Character, co-written
with David McKenna. The chapter is called “What’s the Big Deal?”
and puts forward a way of thinking about scenes that may help you
determine when they have done their job and when to end them.
You will find this in the section called “The Rest of the Story,’ where
I have gathered some of the additional tools that round out a storyteller’s mastery of the craft.
The section on the archetypal patterns of character has been
expanded with a checklist of character questions under the title
“Beyond Archetypes.”
To the section in which I trace the Hero’s Journey in specific films
I have added an analysis of Guillermo del Toro’s magical dream of a
movie, The Shape of Water, because its humanity and imagery have
stuck with me like few other films of recent years. And finally, I have
overhauled the manuscript to eliminate awkward phrasing and mistakes, though I am sure some linger and that careful, helpful readers
will continue to find them and point them out.

PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY
“This is the tale I pray the divine Muse to unfold to us.
Begin it, goddess, at whatever point you will.”
— The Odyssey of Homer
invite you to join me on a Writer's Journey, a
mission of discovery to explore and map the
elusive borderlands between myth and modern
storytelling. We will be guided by a simple idea:
All stories consist of a few common structural elements found universally in myths, fairy tales, dreams, and
movies. They are known collectively as The Hero’s Journey. Understanding these elements and their use in modern writing is the object
of our quest. Used wisely, these ancient tools of the storyteller’s craft
still have tremendous power to heal our people and make the world
a better place.
My own Writer’s Journey begins with the peculiar power storytelling has always had over me. I got hooked on the fairy tales and
Little Golden Books read out loud by my mother and grandmother.
I devoured the cartoons and movies pouring out of TV in the 1950s,
the thrilling adventures on the drive-in screens, the lurid comic books,
and mind-stretching science fiction of the day. When I was laid up
with a sprained ankle, my father went to the local library and brought
INTRODUCTION TO PREVIOUS EDITION
back wonder stories of Norse and Celtic mythology that made me
forget the pain.
A trail of stories eventually led me to reading for a living as a
story analyst for Hollywood studios. Though I evaluated thousands
of novels and screenplays, I never got tired of exploring the labyrinth
of story with its stunningly repeated patterns, bewildering variants,
and puzzling questions.
Where do stories come from? How do they work? What do they
tell us about ourselves? What do they mean? Why do we need them?
How can we use them to improve the world?
Above all, how do storytellers manage to make the story mean
something? Good stories make you feel you've been through a satisfying, complete experience. You've cried or laughed or both. You
finish the story feeling you've learned something about life or about
yourself. Perhaps you've picked up a new awareness, a new character
or attitude to model your life on. How do storytellers manage to pull
that off? What are the secrets of this ancient trade? What are its rules
and design principles?
Over the years I began to notice some common elements in
adventure stories and myths, certain intriguingly familiar characters,
props, locations, and situations. I became vaguely aware there was a
pattern or a template of some sort guiding the design of stories. I had
some pieces of the puzzle but the overall plan eluded me.
Then at the USC film school I was fortunate enough to cross
paths with the work of the mythologist Joseph Campbell. The
encounter with Campbell was, for me and many other people, a
life-changing experience. A few days of exploring the labyrinth of
his book The Hero With a Thousand Faces produced an electrifying
reorganization of my life and thinking. Here, fully explored, was the
pattern I had been sensing. Campbell had broken the secret code of
story. His work was like a flare suddenly illuminating a deeply shadowed landscape.
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
I worked with Campbell’s idea of the Hero’s Journey to understand the phenomenal repeat business of movies such as Star Wars
and Close Encounters. People were going back to see these films as if
seeking some kind of religious experience. It seemed to me these films
drew people in this special way because they reflected the universally
satisfying patterns Campbell found in myths. They had something
people needed.
The Hero With a Thousand Faces was a lifesaver when I began to
work as a story analyst for major movie studios. In my first jobs I was
deeply grateful for Campbell’s work, which became a reliable set of
tools for diagnosing story problems and prescribing solutions. Without the guidance of Campbell and mythology, I would have been lost.
It seemed to me the Hero’s Journey was exciting, useful story
technology which could help filmmakers and executives eliminate
some of the guesswork and expense of developing stories for film.
Over the years, I ran into quite a few people who had been affected
by encounters with Joe Campbell. We were like a secret society of true
believers, commonly putting our faith in “the power of myth.”
Shortly after going to work as a story analyst for the Walt Disney Company, I wrote a seven-page memo called “A Practical Guide
to The Hero With a Thousand Faces” in which I described the idea of
the Hero's Journey, with examples from classic and current movies.
I gave the memo to friends, colleagues, and several Disney executives to test and refine the ideas through their feedback. Gradually I
expanded the “Practical Guide” into a longer essay and began teaching the material through a story analysis class at the UCLA Extension
Writers’ Program.
At writers’ conferences around the country I tested the ideas in
seminars with screenwriters, romance novelists, children’s writers, and
all kinds of storytellers. I found many others were exploring the intertwined pathways of myth, story, and psychology.
xvi
INTRODUCTION TO PREVIOUS EDITION
The Hero’s Journey, I discovered, is more than just a description
of the hidden patterns of mythology. It is a useful guide to life, especially the writer’s life. In the perilous adventure of my own writing, I
found the stages of the Hero’s Journey showing up just as reliably and
usefully as they did in books, myths, and movies. In my personal life,
I was thankful to have this map to guide my quest and help me anticipate what was around the next bend.
The usefulness of the Hero’s Journey as a guide to life was brought
home forcefully when I first prepared to speak publicly about it in a
large seminar at UCLA. A couple of weeks before the seminar two
articles appeared in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, in which a
film critic attacked producer George Lucas and his film Willow (now
under development as a Disney+ TV series). Somehow the critic had
got hold of the “Practical Guide” and claimed it had deeply influenced
and corrupted Hollywood storytellers. The critic blamed the “Practical Guide” for every flop from Ishtar to Howard the Duck, as well as
for the hit Back to the Future. According to him, lazy, illiterate studio
executives, eager to find a quick-bucks formula, had seized upon the
“Practical Guide” as a cure-all and were busily stuffing it down the
throats of writers, stifling their creativity with a technology the executives hadn’t bothered to understand.
While flattered that someone thought I had such a sweeping
influence on the collective mind of Hollywood, I was also devastated.
Here, on the threshold of a new phase of working with these ideas, |
was shot down before I even started. Or so it seemed.
Friends who were more seasoned veterans in this war of ideas
pointed out that in being challenged I was merely encountering an
archetype, one of the familiar characters who people the landscape
of the Hero’s Journey, namely a Threshold Guardian.
That information instantly gave me my bearings and showed me
how to handle the situation. Campbell had described how heroes
often encounter these “unfamiliar yet strangely intimate forces, some
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of which severely threaten” them. The Guardians seem to pop up at
the various thresholds of the journey, the narrow and dangerous passages from one stage of life to the next. Campbell showed the many
ways in which heroes can deal with Threshold Guardians. Instead of
attacking these seemingly hostile powers head-on, journeyers learn to
outwit them or join forces with them, absorbing their energy rather
than being destroyed by it.
I realized that this Threshold Guardian’s apparent attack was
potentially a blessing, not a curse. I had thought of challenging the
critic to a duel (laptops at twenty paces) but now reconsidered. With
a slight change in attitude I could turn his hostility to my benefit. I
contacted the critic and invited him to talk over our differences of
opinion at the seminar. He accepted and joined a panel discussion
which turned into a lively and entertaining debate, illuminating corners of the story world that I had never glimpsed before. The seminar
was better and my ideas were stronger for being challenged. Instead of
fighting my Threshold Guardian, I had absorbed him into my adventure. What had seemed like a lethal blow had turned into something
useful and healthy. The mythological approach had proven its worth
in life as well as story.
Around this time, I realized the “Practical Guide” and Campbell’s
ideas did have an influence on Hollywood. I began to get requests
from studio story departments for copies of the “Practical Guide.”
I heard that executives at other studios were giving the pamphlet to
writers, directors, and producers as guides to universal, commercial
story patterns. Apparently Hollywood was finding the Hero's Journey useful.
Meanwhile Joseph Campbell’s ideas exploded into a wider sphere
of awareness with the Bill Moyers interview show on PBS, The Power
of Myth. The show was a hit, cutting across lines of age, politics, and
religion to speak directly to people’s spirits. The book version, a transcript of the interviews, was on the New York Times bestseller list for
XViii
INTRODUCTION TO PREVIOUS EDITION
over a year. The Hero With a Thousand Faces, Campbell’s venerable
warhorse of a textbook, suddenly became a hot bestseller after forty
years of slow but steady backlist sales.
The PBS show brought Campbell’s ideas to millions and illuminated the impact of his work on filmmakers such as George Lucas,
John Boorman, Steven Spielberg, and George Miller. Suddenly I
found a sharp increase in awareness and acceptance of Campbell’s
ideas in Hollywood. More executives and writers were versed in these
concepts and interested in learning how to apply them to moviemaking and screenwriting.
The Hero’s Journey model continued to serve me well. It got me
through reading and evaluating over ten thousand screenplays for half
a dozen studios. It was my atlas, a book of maps for my own writing
journeys. It guided me to a new role in the Disney company, as a story
consultant for the Feature Animation division at the time The Little
Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast were being conceived. Campbell's
ideas were of tremendous value as I researched and developed stories
based on fairy tales, mythology, science fiction, comic books, and historical adventure.
Joseph Campbell died in 1987. I met him briefly a couple of times
at seminars. He was still a striking man in his eighties, tall, vigorous,
eloquent, funny, full of energy and enthusiasm, and utterly charming.
Just before his passing, he told me, “Stick with this stuff. It'll take you
a long way.”
I recently discovered that for some time the “Practical Guide”
has been required reading for Disney development executives. Daily
requests for it, as well as countless letters and calls from novelists,
screenwriters, producers, writers, and actors, indicate that the Hero's
Journey ideas are being used and developed more than ever.
And so I come to the writing of this book, the descendant of the
“Practical Guide.” The book is designed somewhat on the model of
the J Ching, with an introductory overview followed by commentaries
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
that expand on the typical stages of the Hero’s Journey. Book One,
Mapping the Journey, is a quick survey of the territory. Chapter 1 is
a revision of the “Practical Guide” and a concentrated presentation of
the twelve-stage Hero’s Journey. You might think of this as the map
of a journey we are about to take together through the special world
of story. Chapter 2 is an introduction to the archetypes, the dramatis
personae of myth and story. It describes eight common character types
or psychological functions found in most stories.
Book Two, Stages of the Journey, is a more detailed examination
of the twelve elements of the Hero’s Journey. Each chapter is followed
by suggestions for your further exploration, Questioning the Journey.
An epilogue, Looking Back on the Journey, deals with the special
adventure of the Writer’s Journey and some pitfalls to avoid on the
road. It includes Hero’s Journey analyses of influential films including Titanic, The Lion King, Pulp Fiction, The Shape of Water, and Star
Wars. In one case, The Lion King, I had the opportunity to apply the
Hero's Journey ideas as a story consultant during the development
process, and saw firsthand how useful these principles can be.
Throughout the book I make reference to movies, both classic
and current. You might want to view some of these films to see how
the Hero's Journey works in practice. A representative list of films can
be found in the Filmography in the Appendix section.
You might also select a single movie or story of your choice and
keep it in mind as you take the Writer’s Journey. Get to know the story
of your choice by reading or viewing it several times, taking brief notes
on what happens in each scene and how it functions in the drama.
Viewing a movie on a device of your choice is useful if you can pause
it to write down the content of each scene and grasp its meaning and
relation to the rest of the story.
I suggest you go through this process with a story or movie and
use it to test out the ideas in this book. See if your story reflects the
stages and archetypes of the Hero’s Journey. Observe how the stages
INTRODUCTION TO PREVIOUS EDITION
are adapted to meet the needs of the story or the particular culture
for which the story was written. Challenge these ideas, test them in
practice, adapt them to your needs, and make them yours. Use these
concepts to challenge and inspire your own stories.
The Hero’s Journey has served storytellers and their listeners
since the very first stories were told, and it shows no signs of wearing
out. Let’s begin the Writer’s Journey together to explore these ideas.
I hope you find them useful as magic keys to the world of story and
the labyrinth of life.

This book could not be without the support and encouragement of
many friends and allies. My wife Alice always comes to my rescue
with her editing skills and talent for keeping it real. My debt to Joseph
Campbell can never be repaid, for he lit my path through the dark
wood and gave his blessing to my efforts. I will never forget that it was
my friend Ron Deutsch who started the whole adventure by casually
pitching my idea for a book to Michael Wiese, who happened to be
on an adjoining exercise bike. My friend and professional colleague
David McKenna is still my primary sounding board for ideas, and was
a tremendous help in designing the twelve-stage Hero's Journey map,
defining the eight primary archetypes, and finding classic film examples to illustrate these concepts. To the late Michele Montez and her
mate Fritz Springmeyer, who created the illustrations adorning the
present volume, I am forever grateful for their inspired artistry and
craft. 1am thankful for the many teachers who kindly encouraged me,
and for the students who helped me refine and clarify my thoughts
on storytelling. Special thanks to Ken Lee of Michael Wiese Productions, who has patiently put up with my erratic methods for decades
while constantly brainstorming about how to advance the influence
of my work and the MWP publishing brand. Last but far from least,
I rejoice in the friendship and wise guidance of Michael Wiese, who
has been a loyal supporter from the beginning, and whose positive
influence in publishing, independent filmmaking, and the spiritual
development of this planet will resonate for ages to come.

“There are only two or three human stories,
and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely
as if they had never happened before.”
— Willa Cather, in O Pioneers!
n the long run, one of the most influential
books of the 20th century may turn out to
be Joseph Campbell’s The Hero With a Thousand Faces.
The ideas expressed in Campbell’s book
are having a major impact on storytelling. Writers are becoming
more aware of the ageless patterns which Campbell identifies, and
are enriching their work with them.
Inevitably Hollywood has caught on to the usefulness of Campbell’s work. Filmmakers like George Lucas and George Miller
acknowledge their debt to Campbell and his influence can be seen
in the films of Steven Spielberg, John Boorman, Francis Coppola,
Darren Aronofsky, Jon Favreau, and others.
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
It’s little wonder that Hollywood has embraced the ideas Campbell presents in his books. For the writer, producer, director, or
designer his concepts are a welcome tool kit, stocked with sturdy
instruments ideal for the craft of storytelling. With these tools you
can construct a story to meet almost any situation, a story that will
be dramatic, entertaining, and psychologically true. With this equipment you can diagnose the problems of almost any ailing plot line,
and make the corrections to bring it to its peak of performance.
These tools have stood the test of time. They are older than
the Pyramids, older than Stonehenge, older than the earliest cave
paintings.
Joseph Campbell’s contribution to the tool kit was to gather the
ideas together, recognize them, articulate them, name them, organize
them. He exposed for the first time the pattern that lies behind every
story ever told.
The Hero With a Thousand Faces is his statement of the most persistent theme in oral tradition and recorded literature: the myth of the
hero. In his study of world hero myths Campbell discovered that they
are all basically the same story, retold endlessly in infinite variation.
He found that all storytelling, consciously or not, follows the
ancient patterns of myth and that all stories, from the crudest jokes
to the highest flights of literature, can be understood in terms of
the Hero’s Journey: the “monomyth” whose principles he lays out
in the book.
The pattern of the Hero’s Journey is universal, occurring in every
culture, in every time. It is as infinitely varied as the human race itself
and yet its basic form remains constant. The Hero’s Journey is an
incredibly tenacious set of elements that springs endlessly from the
deepest reaches of the human mind; different in its details for every
culture, but fundamentally the same.
Campbell’s thinking runs parallel to that of the Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung, who wrote about the archetypes: constantly
A PRACTICAL GUIDE
repeating characters or energies which occur in the dreams of all people and the myths of all cultures. Jung suggested that these archetypes
reflect different aspects of the human mind — that our personalities
divide themselves into these characters to play out the drama of our
lives. He noticed a strong correspondence between his patients’ dream
figures and the common archetypes of mythology. He suggested that
both were coming from a deeper source, in the collective unconscious
of the human race.
The repeating characters of world myth such as the young hero,
the wise old man or woman, the shapeshifter, and the shadowy antagonist are the same as the figures who appear repeatedly in our dreams
and fantasies. That’s why myths and most stories constructed on the
mythological model have the ring of psychological truth.
Such stories are accurate models of the workings of the human
mind, true maps of the psyche. They are psychologically valid and
emotionally realistic even when they portray fantastic, impossible, or
unreal events.
This accounts for the universal power of such stories. Stories built
on the model of the Hero’s Journey have an appeal that can be felt by
everyone, because they well up from a universal source in the shared
unconscious and reflect universal concerns.
They deal with the childlike universal questions: Who am I?
Where did I come from? Where will I go when I die? What is good
and what is evil? What must I do about it? What will tomorrow be
like? Where did yesterday go? Is there anybody else out there?
The ideas embedded in mythology and identified by Campbell
in The Hero With a Thousand Faces can be applied to understanding
almost any human problem. They are a great key to life as well as a
major instrument for dealing more effectively with a mass audience.
If you want to understand the ideas behind the Hero’s Journey,
there’s no substitute for actually reading Campbell’s work. It’s an experience that has a way of changing people.
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
It’s also a good idea to read a lot of myths, but reading Campbell's
work amounts to the same thing since Campbell is a master storyteller
who delights in illustrating his points with examples from the rich
storehouse of mythology.
Campbell gives an outline of the Hero’s Journey in Chapter IV,
“The Keys,’ of The Hero With a Thousand Faces. Vve taken the liberty
of amending the outline slightly, trying to reflect some of the common themes in movies with illustrations drawn from contemporary
films and a few classics. You can compare the two outlines and terminology by examining Table One.

I'm retelling the hero myth in my own way, and you should feel
free to do the same. Every storyteller bends the mythic pattern to his
or her own purpose or the needs of a particular culture.
That's why the hero has a thousand faces.
A note about the term “hero”: As used here, the word, like “doc-
» a » tor or ‘poet,’ may refer to a person of any gender.
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
At heart, despite its infinite variety, the hero’s story is always a journey. A hero leaves her comfortable, ordinary surroundings to venture
into a challenging, unfamiliar world. It may be an outward journey to
an actual place: a labyrinth, forest, or cave, a strange city or country,
a new locale that becomes the arena for her conflict with antagonistic, challenging forces.
But there are as many stories that take the hero on an inward
journey, one of the mind, the heart, the spirit. In any good story the
hero grows and changes, making a journey from one way of being to
the next: from despair to hope, weakness to strength, folly to wisdom,
love to hate, and back again. It’s these emotional journeys that hook
an audience and make a story worth watching.
The stages of the Hero’s Journey can be traced in all kinds of stories, not just those that feature “heroic” physical action and adventure.
The protagonist of every story is the hero of a journey, even if the path
leads only into his own mind or into the realm of relationships.
The way stations of the Hero’s Journey emerge naturally even
when the writer is unaware of them, but some knowledge of this most
ancient guide to storytelling is useful in identifying problems and telling better stories. Consider these twelve stages as a map of the Hero's
Journey, one of many ways to get from here to there, but one of the
most flexible, durable, and dependable.

THE HERO’S JOURNEY
1. THE ORDINARY WORLD
Most stories take the hero out of the ordinary, mundane world and
into a Special World, new and alien. ‘This is the familiar “fish out of
water” idea which has spawned countless films and TV shows (“The
Fugitive,” “The Beverly Hillbillies” Mr: Smith Goes to Washington, A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, The Wizard of Oz, Witness, 48 Hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, etc.).
If you're going to show a fish out of his customary element, you
first have to show him in that Ordinary World to create a vivid contrast with the strange new world he is about to enter.
In Witness you see both the city policeman and the Amish
mother and son in their normal worlds before they are thrust into
totally alien environments: the Amish being overwhelmed by the city,
and the city cop encountering the 19th-century world of the Amish.
You first see Luke Skywalker, hero of Star Wars, being bored to death
as a farmboy before he sets out to tackle the universe.
Likewise in The Wizard of Oz, considerable time is spent to establish Dorothy’s drab normal life in Kansas before she is blown to the
wonderworld of Oz. Here the contrast is heightened by shooting the
Kansas scenes in stern black and white while the Oz scenes are shot
in vibrant Technicolor.
An Officer and a Gentleman sketches a vivid contrast between
the Ordinary World of the hero — that of a tough Navy brat with a
drunken, whore-chasing father — and the Special World of the spitand-polish Navy flight school which the hero enters.
A PRACTICAL GUIDE
2. THE CALL TO ADVENTURE
The hero is presented with a problem, challenge, or adventure to
undertake. Once presented with a Call to Adventure, she can no
longer remain indefinitely in the comfort of the Ordinary World.
Perhaps the land is dying, as in the King Arthur stories of the
search for the Grail, the only treasure that can heal the wounded land.
In Star Wars, the Call to Adventure is Princess Leia’s desperate holographic message to wise old Obi Wan Kenobi, who asks Luke to join
in the quest. Leia has been snatched by evil Darth Vader, like the
Greek springtime goddess Persephone, who was kidnapped to the
underworld by Pluto, lord of the dead. Her rescue is vital to restoring
the normal balance of the universe.
In many detective stories, the Call to Adventure is the private eye
being asked to take on a new case and solve a crime which has upset
the order of things. A good detective should right wrongs as well as
solve crimes.
In revenge plots, the Call to Adventure is often a wrong which
must be set right, an offense against the natural order of things. In
The Count of Monte Cristo, Edmond Dantes is unjustly imprisoned
and is driven to escape by his desire for revenge. The plot of Beverly
Hills Cop is set in motion by the murder of the hero’s best friend. Jn
First Blood Rambo is motivated by his unfair treatment at the hands
of an intolerant sheriff.
In romantic comedies, the Call to Adventure might be the first
encounter with the special but annoying someone the hero or heroine
will be pursuing and sparring with.
The Call to Adventure establishes the stakes of the game, and
makes clear the hero’s goal: to win the treasure or the lover, to get
revenge or right a wrong, to achieve a dream, confront a challenge,
or change a life.
What’s at stake can often be expressed as a question posed by the
call. Will E.T. or Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz get home again? Will
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Luke rescue Princess Leia and defeat Darth Vader? In An Officer and
a Gentleman, will the hero be driven out of Navy flight school by his
own selfishness and the needling of a fierce Marine drill instructor,
or will he earn the right to be called an officer and a gentleman? Boy
meets girl, but does boy get girl?
3, REFUSAL OF THE CALL (THE RELUCTANT HERO)
This one is about fear. Often at this point the hero balks at the threshold
of adventure, Refusing the Call or expressing reluctance. After all, she is
facing the greatest of all fears, terror of the unknown. The hero has not
yet fully committed to the journey and may still be thinking of turning back. Some other influence — a change in circumstances, a further
offense against the natural order of things, or the encouragement of a
Mentor — is required to get her past this turning point of fear.
In romantic comedies, the hero may express reluctance to get
involved (maybe because of the pain of a previous relationship). In a
detective story, the private eye may at first turn down the case, only
to take it on later against his better judgment.
At this point in Star Wars, Luke refuses Obi Wan’s Call to Adventure and returns to his aunt and uncle’s farmhouse, only to find they
have been barbecued by the Emperor’s stormtroopers. Suddenly Luke
is no longer reluctant and is eager to undertake the quest. The evil of
the Empire has become personal to him. He is motivated.
4, MENTOR (THE WISE OLD MAN oR WoMAN)
By this time many stories will have introduced a Merlin-like character
who is the hero’s Mentor. The relationship between hero and Mentor
is one of the most common themes in mythology, and one of the richest in its symbolic value. It stands for the bond between parent and
child, teacher and student, doctor and patient, god and man.
The Mentor may appear as a wise old wizard (Star Wars), a tough
drill sergeant (An Officer and a Gentleman), or a grizzled old boxing
A PRACTICAL GUIDE
coach (Rocky). In the mythology of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show? it
was Mary's grumpy but good-hearted boss Lou Grant. In Jaws, it’s the
crusty Robert Shaw character who knows all about sharks.
The function of Mentors is to prepare the hero to face the
unknown. They may give advice, guidance, or magical equipment.
Obi Wan in Star Wars gives Luke his father’s lightsaber, which he
will need in his battles with the dark side of the Force. In The Wizard
of Oz, Glinda the Good Witch gives Dorothy guidance and the ruby
slippers that will eventually get her home again.
However, the Mentor can only go so far with the hero. Eventually the hero must face the unknown alone. Sometimes the Mentor
is required to give the hero a swift kick in the pants to get the adventure going.
5. CROSSING THE FirsT THRESHOLD
Now the hero finally commits to the adventure and fully enters the
Special World of the story for the first time by Crossing the First
Threshold. He agrees to face the consequences of dealing with the
problem or challenge posed in the Cal! to Adventure. This is the
moment when the story takes off and the adventure really gets going.
The balloon goes up, the ship sails, the romance begins, the plane or
the spaceship soars off, the wagon train gets rolling.
Movies are often built in three acts, which can be regarded as representing 1) the hero’s decision to act, 2) the action itself, and 3) the
consequences of the action. The First Threshold marks the turning
point between Acts One and Two. The hero, having overcome fear,
has decided to confront the problem and take action. She is now committed to the journey and there’s no turning back.
This is the moment when Dorothy sets out on the Yellow Brick
Road. The hero of Beverly Hills Cop, Axel Foley, decides to defy his
boss’s order, leaving his Ordinary World of the Detroit streets to investigate his friend's murder in the Special World of Beverly Hills.
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
6. Tests, ALLIES, AND ENEMIES
Once across the First Threshold, the hero naturally encounters new
challenges and Tests, makes Allies and Enemies, and begins to learn
the rules of the Special World.
Saloons and seedy bars seem to be good places for these transactions. Countless Westerns take the hero to a saloon where his
manhood and determination are tested, and where friends and villains
are introduced. Bars are also useful to the hero for obtaining information, for learning the new rules that apply to the Special World.
In Casablanca, Rick’s Cafe is the den of intrigue in which alliances and enmities are forged, and in which the hero’s moral character
is constantly tested. In Episode IV:_ A New Hope (the first Star Wars
film to be released), the cantina is the setting for the creation of a
major alliance with Han Solo and the making of an important enmity
with Jabba the Hutt, which pays off two movies later in Return of the
Jedi. Here in the giddy, surreal, violent atmosphere of the cantina
swarming with bizarre aliens, Luke also gets a taste of the exciting and
dangerous Special World he has just entered.
Scenes like these allow for character development as we watch
the hero and his companions react under stress. In the Star Wars cantina, Luke gets to see Han Solo’s way of handling a tight situation, and
learns that Obi Wan is a warrior wizard of great power.
There are similar sequences in An Officer and a Gentleman at
about this point, in which the hero makes allies and enemies and
meets his “love interest.” Several aspects of the hero’s character —
aggressiveness and hostility, knowledge of street fighting, attitudes
about women — are revealed under pressure in these scenes, and sure
enough, one of them takes place in a bar.
Of course not all Tests, Alliances, and Enmities are confronted
in bars. In many stories, such as The Wizard of Oz, these are simply
encounters on the road. At this stage on the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy
acquires her companions the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman and Cowardly
14
A PRACTICAL GUIDE
Lion, and makes enemies such as an orchard full of grumpy talking trees.
She passes a number of Tests such as getting Scarecrow off the nail, oiling
the Tin Woodsman, and helping the Cowardly Lion deal with his fear.
In Star Wars the Tests continue after the cantina scene. Obi Wan
teaches Luke about the Force by making him fight blindfolded. The
early laser battles with the Imperial fighters are another Test which
Luke successfully passes.
7, APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
The hero comes at last to the edge of a dangerous place, sometimes
deep underground, where the object of the quest is hidden. Often it’s
the headquarters of the hero's greatest enemy, the most dangerous spot
in the Special World, the Inmost Cave. When the hero enters that
fearful place he will cross the second major threshold. Heroes often
pause at the gate to prepare, plan, and outwit the villain’s guards. This
is the phase of Approach.
In mythology the Inmost Cave may represent the land of the
dead. The hero may have to descend into hell to rescue a loved one
(Orpheus), into a cave to fight a dragon and win a treasure (Sigurd
in Norse myth), or into a labyrinth to confront a monster (Theseus
and the Minotaur).
In the Arthurian stories the Inmost Cave is the Chapel Perilous,
the dangerous chamber where the seeker may find the Grail.
In the modern mythology of Star Wars, the Approach to the
Inmost Cave is Luke Skywalker and company being sucked into the
Death Star where they will face Darth Vader and rescue Princess Leia.
In The Wizard of Oz, it’s Dorothy being kidnapped to the Wicked
Witch’s baleful castle, and her companions slipping in to save her.
The title of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom reveals the Inmost
Cave of that film.
Approach covers all the preparations for entering the Inmost
Cave and confronting death or supreme danger.
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
8. THE ORDEAL
Here the fortunes of the hero hit bottom in a direct confrontation with
his greatest fear. He faces the possibility of death and is brought to the
brink in a battle with a hostile force. The Ordeal is a “black moment”
for the audience, as we are held in suspense and tension, not knowing
if he will live or die. The hero, like Jonah, is “in the belly of the beast.”
In Star Wars it’s the harrowing moment in the bowels of the
Death Star when Luke, Leia, and company are trapped in the giant
trash masher. Luke is pulled under by the tentacled monster that lives
in the sewage and is held down so long that the audience begins to
wonder if he’s dead. In E.7., the lovable alien momentarily appears
to die on the operating table. In The Wizard of Oz Dorothy and her
friends are trapped by the Wicked Witch, and it looks like there’s no
way out. At this point in Beverly Hills Cop Axel Foley is in the clutches
of the villain’s men with a gun to his head.
In An Officer and a Gentleman, Zack Mayo endures an Ordeal
when his Marine drill instructor launches an all-out drive to torment
and humiliate him into quitting the program. It’s a psychological lifeor-death moment, for if he gives in, his chances of becoming an officer
and a gentleman will be dead. He survives the Ordeal by refusing to
quit, and the Ordeal changes him. The drill sergeant, a foxy Wise Old
Man, has forced him to admit his dependency on others, and from
this moment on he is more cooperative and less selfish.
In romantic comedies the death faced by the hero may simply be
the temporary death of the relationship, as in the second movement
of the old standard plot, “Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.”
The hero's chances of connecting with the object of affection look
their bleakest.
The Ordeal is a critical moment in which the hero must die
or appear to die so that she can be born again. It’s a major source of
the magic of the heroic myth. The experiences of the preceding stages
have led us, the audience, to identify with the hero and her fate. What
16
A PRACTICAL GUIDE
happens to the hero happens to us. We are encouraged to experience
the brink-of-death moment with her. Our emotions are temporarily
depressed so that they can be revived by the hero’s return from death.
The result of this revival is a feeling of elation and exhilaration.
The designers of amusement park thrill rides know how to use
this principle. Roller coasters make their passengers feel as if they’re
going to die, and there’s a great thrill that comes from brushing up
against death and surviving it. You’re never more alive than when
you re looking death in the face.
This is also the key element in rites of passage or rituals of initiation
into fraternities and secret societies. The initiate is forced to taste death
in some terrible experience, and then is allowed to experience resurrection as he is reborn as a new member of the group. The hero of every
story is an initiate being introduced to the mysteries of life and death.
Every story needs such a life-or-death moment in which the hero
or his goals are in mortal jeopardy.
9. REWARD (SEIZING THE SWORD)
Having survived death, beaten the dragon, or slain the Minotaur, hero
and audience have cause to celebrate. The hero now takes possession
of the treasure she has come seeking, her Reward. It might be a special weapon like a magic sword, or a token like the Grail or some elixir
which can heal the wounded land.
Sometimes the “sword” is knowledge and experience that leads to
greater understanding and a reconciliation with hostile forces.
In Star Wars, Luke rescues Princess Leia and captures the plans
of the Death Star, keys to defeating Darth Vader.
Dorothy escapes from the Wicked Witch’s castle with the Witch’s
broomstick and the ruby slippers, keys to getting back home.
At this point the hero may also settle a conflict with a parent. In
Return of the Jedi, Luke is reconciled with Darth Vader, who turns out
to be his father and not such a bad guy after all.
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The hero may also be reconciled with the opposite sex, as in
romantic comedies. In many stories the loved one is the treasure the
hero has come to win or rescue, and there is often a love scene at this
point to celebrate the victory.
From the hero’s point of view, members of the opposite sex may
appear to be Shapeshifters, an archetype of change. They seem to
shift constantly in form or age, reflecting the confusing and constantly
changing aspects of the opposite sex. Tales of vampires, werewolves,
and other shape-changers are symbolic echoes of this shifting quality
which men and women see in each other.
The hero’s Ordeal may grant a better understanding of the opposite sex, an ability to see beyond the shifting outer appearance, leading
to a reconciliation.
The hero may also become more attractive as a result of having
survived the Ordeal. He has earned the title of “hero” by having taken
the supreme risk on behalf of the community.
10. THE ROAD BAck
The hero’s not out of the woods yet. We’re crossing into Act Three
now as the hero begins to deal with the consequences of confronting
the dark forces of the Ordeal. If she has not yet managed to reconcile
with the parent, the gods, or the hostile forces, they may come raging
after her. Some of the best chase scenes spring up at this point, as the
hero is pursued on The Road Back by the vengeful forces she has disturbed by Seizing the sword, the elixir, or the treasure.
Thus Luke and Leia are furiously pursued by Darth Vader as they
escape the Death Star. The Road Back in £.7. is the moonlight bicycle
flight of Elliott and E.T. as they escape from “Keys” (Peter Coyote),
who represents repressive governmental authority.
This stage marks the decision to return to the Ordinary World.
The hero realizes that the Special World must eventually be left
behind, and there are still dangers, temptations, and tests ahead.
A PRACTICAL GUIDE
11. RESURRECTION
In ancient times, hunters and warriors had to be purified before they
returned to their communities, because they had blood on their hands.
The hero who has been to the realm of the dead must be reborn and
cleansed in one last Ordeal of death and Resurrection before returning to the Ordinary World of the living.
This is often a second life-and-death moment, almost a replay of
the death and rebirth of the Ordeal. Death and darkness get in one
last, desperate shot before being finally defeated. It’s a kind of final
exam for the hero, who must be tested once more to see if he has really
learned the lessons of the Ordeal.
The hero is transformed by these moments of death-and-rebirth,
and is able to return to ordinary life reborn as a new being with
new insights.
The Star Wars films play with this element constantly. The films
of the “original trilogy” feature a final battle scene in which Luke is
almost killed, appears to be dead for a moment, and then miraculously
survives. Each Ordeal wins him new knowledge and command over
the Force. He is transformed into a new being by his experience.
Axel Foley in the climactic sequence of Beverly Hills Cop once again
faces death at the hands of the villain, but is rescued by the intervention
of the Beverly Hills police force. He emerges from the experience with
a greater respect for cooperation, and is a more complete human being.
An Officer and a Gentleman offers a more complex series of final
ordeals, as the hero faces death in a number of ways. Zack’s selfishness
dies as he gives up the chance for a personal athletic trophy in favor
of helping another cadet over an obstacle. His relationship with his
girlfriend seems to be dead, and he must survive the crushing blow of
his best friend’s suicide. As if that weren’t enough, he also endures a
final hand-to-hand, life-or-death battle with his drill instructor, but
survives it all and is transformed into the gallant “officer and gentleman” of the title.

12. RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR
The hero Returns to the Ordinary World, but the journey is meaningless unless she brings back some Elixir, treasure, or lesson from the
Special World. The Elixir is a magic potion with the power to heal. It
may be a great treasure like the Grail that magically heals the wounded
land, or it simply might be knowledge or experience that could be useful to the community someday.
Dorothy returns to Kansas with the knowledge that she is loved,
and that “There’s no place like home.” E.T. returns home with the
experience of friendship with humans. Luke Skywalker defeats Darth
Vader (for the time being) and restores peace and order to the galaxy.
Zack Mayo wins his commission and leaves the Special World of
the training base with a new perspective. In the sparkling new uniform of an officer (with a new attitude to match) he literally sweeps
his girlfriend off her feet and carries her away.
Sometimes the Elixir is treasure won on the quest, but it may
be love, freedom, wisdom, or the knowledge that the Special World
exists and can be survived. Sometimes it’s just coming home with a
good story to tell.
Unless something is brought back from the Ordeal in the Inmost
Cave, the hero is doomed to repeat the adventure. Many comedies
use this ending, as a foolish character refuses to learn his lesson and
embarks on the same folly that got him in trouble in the first place.

The Hero’s Journey is a skeletal framework that should be fleshed out
with the details and surprises of the individual story. The structure
should not call attention to itself, nor should it be followed too precisely. The order of the stages given here is only one of many possible
variations. The stages can be deleted, added to, and drastically shuffled
without losing any of their power.
The values of the Hero's Journey are what's important. The images
of the basic version — young heroes seeking magic swords from old
wizards, maidens risking death to save loved ones, knights riding off
to fight evil dragons in deep caves, and so on — are just symbols of
universal life experiences. The symbols can be changed infinitely to
suit the story at hand and the needs of the society.
The Hero’s Journey is easily translated to contemporary dramas,
comedies, romances, or action-adventures by substituting modern
equivalents for the symbolic figures and props of the heros story. The
wise old man or woman may be a real shaman or wizard, but may
also be any kind of Mentor or teacher, doctor or therapist, “crusty

but benign” boss, tough but fair top sergeant, parent, grandparent, or
guiding, helping figure.
Modern heroes may not be going into caves and labyrinths to
fight mythical beasts, but they do enter a Special World and an Inmost
Cave by venturing into space, to the bottom of the sea, into the depths
of a modern city, or into their own hearts.
The patterns of myth can be used to tell the simplest comic book
story or the most sophisticated drama. The Hero’s Journey grows and
matures as new experiments are tried within its framework. Changing the traditional sex and relative ages of the archetypes only makes it
more interesting, and allows ever more complex webs of understanding to be spun among them. The basic figures can be combined, or
each can be divided into several characters to show different aspects
of the same idea.
The Hero’s Journey is infinitely flexible, capable of endless variation without sacrificing any of its magic, and it will outlive us all.
Now that we've looked over the map, let’s meet the characters
who populate the landscape of storytelling: the Archetypes.

“Summoned or not, the god will come.”
— Motto over the door of Carl Jung’s house
s soon as you enter the world of fairy tales and
myths, you become aware of recurring character types and relationships: questing heroes,
heralds who call them to adventure, wise old
men and women who give them magical gifts,
threshold guardians who seem to block their way, shapeshifting fellow travelers who confuse and dazzle them, shadowy villains who
try to destroy them, tricksters who upset the status quo and provide
comic relief. In describing these common character types, symbols,
and relationships the Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung employed the
term archetypes, meaning ancient patterns of personality that are the
shared heritage of the human race.
Jung suggested there may be a collective unconscious, similar to
the personal unconscious. Fairy tales and myths are like the dreams of
an entire culture, springing from the collective unconscious. The same
character types seem to occur on both the personal and the collective
scale. The archetypes are amazingly constant throughout all times
and cultures, in the dreams and personalities of individuals as well as
in the mythic imagination of the entire world. An understanding of
25
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
these forces is one of the most powerful elements in the modern storyteller’s bag of tricks.
The concept of archetypes is an indispensable tool for understanding the purpose or function of characters in a story. If you grasp the
function of the archetype which a particular character is expressing, it
can help you determine if the character is pulling her full weight in the
story. The archetypes are part of the universal language of storytelling,
and a command of their energy is as essential to the writer as breathing.
Joseph Campbell spoke of the archetypes as biological: as expressions of the organs of the body, built into the wiring of every human
being. The universality of these patterns makes possible the shared
experience of storytelling. Storytellers instinctively choose characters
and relationships that resonate to the energy of the archetypes, to create dramatic experiences that are recognizable to everyone. Becoming
aware of the archetypes can only expand your command of your craft.
ARCHETYPES AS FUNCTIONS
When I first began working with these ideas I thought of an archetype
as a fixed role which a character would play exclusively throughout a
story. Once I identified a character as a mentor, I expected her to remain
a mentor and only a mentor. However, as I worked with fairy-tale motifs
as a story consultant for Disney Animation, I encountered another way
of looking at the archetypes — not as rigid character roles but as functions performed temporarily by characters to achieve certain effects in
a story. This observation comes from the work of the Russian fairy-tale
expert Vladimir Propp, whose book, Morphology of the Folktale, analyzes motifs and recurrent patterns in hundreds of Russian tales.
Looking at the archetypes in this way, as flexible character functions rather than as rigid character types, can liberate your storytelling.
It explains how a character in a story can manifest the qualities of more
than one archetype. The archetypes can be thought of as masks, worn
by the characters temporarily as they are needed to advance the story.
26
THE ARCHETYPES
A character might enter the story performing the function of a herald,
then switch masks to function as a trickster, a mentor, and a shadow.
FACETS OF THE HERO’S PERSONALITY
Another way to look at the classic archetypes is that they are facets of
the hero’s (or the writer’s) personality. The other characters represent
possibilities for the hero, for good or ill. A hero sometimes proceeds
through the story gathering and incorporating the energy and traits
of the other characters. She learns from the other characters, fusing
them into a complete human being who has picked up something
from everyone she has met along the way.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY

The archetypes can also be regarded as personified symbols of various human qualities. Like the major arcana cards of the Tarot, they
stand for the aspects of a complete human personality. Every good
story reflects the total human story, the universal human condition of
being born into this world, growing, learning, struggling to become an
individual, and dying. Stories can be read as metaphors for the general
human situation, with characters who embody universal, archetypal
qualities, comprehensible to the group as well as the individual.
THE MOST COMMON AND USEFUL ARCHETYPES
For the storyteller, certain character archetypes are indispensable tools
of the trade. You can’t tell stories without them. The archetypes that
occur most frequently in stories, and that seem to be the most useful
for the writer to understand, are:
HERO
MENTOR (Wise Old Man or Woman)
THRESHOLD GUARDIAN
HERALD
SHAPESHIFTER
SHADOW
ALLY
TRICKSTER
There are, of course, many more archetypes; as many as there
are human qualities to dramatize in stories. Fairy tales are crowded
with archetypal figures: the Wolf, the Hunter, the Good Mother, the
Wicked Stepmother, the Fairy Godmother, the Witch, the Prince or
Princess, the Greedy Innkeeper, and so forth, who perform highly specialized functions. Jung and others have identified many psychological
archetypes, such as the pwer aeternus or eternal boy, who can be found
in myths as the ever-youthful Cupid, in stories as characters such as
Peter Pan, and in life as men who never want to grow up.
28
THE ARCHETYPES
Particular genres of modern stories have their specialized character types, such as the “Whore with the Heart of Gold” or the
“Arrogant West Point Lieutenant” in Westerns, the “Good Cop/Bad
Cop” pairing in buddy pictures, or the “Tough but Fair Sergeant” in
war movies.
However, these are only variants and refinements of the archetypes discussed in the following chapters. The archetypes we will
discuss are the most basic patterns, from which all others are shaped
to fit the needs of specific stories and genres.
Two questions are helpful for a writer trying to identify the
nature of an archetype: 1) What psychological function or part of
the personality does it represent? and 2) What is its dramatic function in a story?
Keep these questions in mind as we look at eight of the basic
archetypes, the people or energies we are likely to meet on the
Hero’s Journey.
22
alae
“We've on a mission from God.”
— from The Blues Brothers screenplay
by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis
he word hero is Greek, from a root that means
“to protect and to serve” (incidentally the
motto of the Los Angeles Police Department).
From the beginning, the idea of Hero is connected with self-sacrifice. A hero is someone
willing to sacrifice his or her needs on behalf of others, like a shepherd who will endure loneliness, discomfort, and danger to protect
and serve the flock.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION
In psychological terms, the archetype of the Hero represents what
Freud called the ego — that part of the personality that separates
from the mother — which considers itself distinct from the rest of the
human race. Ultimately, a Hero is one who can transcend the bounds
and illusions of the ego, but at first, Heroes are all ego: the I, the one,
that personal identity which thinks it is separate from the rest of the
group. The journey of many Heroes is the story of that separation
31
THE WRITER'S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
from the family or tribe, equivalent to a child’s sense of separation
from the mother.
The Hero archetype represents the ego’s search for identity and
wholeness. In the process of becoming complete, integrated human
beings, we are all Heroes facing internal guardians, monsters, and
helpers. In the quest to explore our own minds we find teachers,
guides, demons, gods, mates, servants, scapegoats, masters, seducers,
betrayers, and allies, as aspects of our personalities and characters in
our dreams. All the villains, tricksters, lovers, friends, and foes of the
Hero can be found inside ourselves. The psychological task we all face
is to integrate these separate parts into one complete, balanced entity.
The ego, the Hero thinking she is separate from all these parts of herself, must incorporate them to become the Self.
DRAMATIC FUNCTIONS
AUDIENCE IDENTIFICATION
The dramatic purpose of the Hero is to give the audience a window
into the story. Each person hearing a tale or watching a play or movie
is invited, in the early stages of the story, to identify with the Hero,
to merge with him and see the world of the story through his eyes.
Storytellers do this by giving their Heroes a combination of qualities,
a mix of universal and unique characteristics.
Heroes have qualities that we all can identify with and recognize
in ourselves. They are propelled by universal drives that we can all
understand: the desire to be loved and understood, to succeed, survive, be free, get revenge, right wrongs, or seek self-expression.
Stories invite us to invest part of our personal identity in the
Hero for the duration of the experience. In a sense we become the
Hero for a while. We project ourselves into the Hero’s psyche, and
see the world through her eyes. Heroes need some admirable qualities, so that we want to be like them. We want to experience the
32
HERO
self-confidence of Katharine Hepburn, the elegance of Fred Astaire,
the wit of Cary Grant, the sexiness of Marilyn Monroe.
Heroes should have universal qualities, emotions, and motivations that everyone has experienced at one time or another: revenge,
anger, lust, competition, territoriality, patriotism, idealism, cynicism,
or despair. But Heroes must also be unique human beings, rather than
stereotypical creatures or tin gods without flaws or unpredictability.
Like any effective work of art they need both universality and originality. Nobody wants to see a movie or read a story about abstract
qualities in human form. We want stories about real people. A real
character, like a real person, is not just a single trait but a unique combination of many qualities and drives, some of them conflicting. And
the more conflicting, the better. A character torn by warring allegiances to love and duty is inherently interesting to an audience. A
character who has a unique combination of contradictory impulses,
such as trust and suspicion or hope and despair, seems more realistic
and human than one who displays only one character trait.
A well-rounded Hero can be determined, uncertain, charming,
forgetful, impatient, and strong in body but weak at heart, all at the
same time. It’s the particular combination of qualities that gives an
audience the sense that the Hero is one of a kind, a real person rather
than a type.
GROW TH
Another story function of the Hero is learning or growth. In evaluating a script sometimes it’s hard to tell who the main character is, or
who should be. Often the best answer is: the one who learns or grows
the most in the course of the story. Heroes overcome obstacles and
achieve goals, but they also gain new knowledge and wisdom. The
heart of many stories is the learning that goes on between a Hero and
a mentor, or a Hero and a lover, or even between a Hero and a villain.
We are all each other’s teachers.
33
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
ACTION
Another heroic function is acting or doing. The Hero is usually the
most active person in the script. His will and desire is what drives
most stories forward. A frequent flaw in screenplays is that the Hero
is fairly active throughout the story, but at the most critical moment
becomes passive and is rescued by the timely arrival of some outside force. At this moment above all, a Hero should be fully active,
in control of his own fate. The Hero should perform the decisive
action of the story, the action that requires taking the most risk or
responsibility.
SAGKIFIGE
People commonly think of Heroes as strong or brave, but these qualities are secondary to sacrifice — the true mark of a Hero. Sacrifice is
the Hero's willingness to give up something of value, perhaps even her
own life, on behalf of an ideal or a group.
Sacrifice means “making holy.” In ancient times people made sacrifices, even of human beings, to acknowledge their debt to the spirit
world, the gods, or nature, to appease those mighty forces, and to
make holy the processes of daily life. Even death became sanctified,
a holy act.
DEALING WITH DEATH
At the heart of every story is a confrontation with death. If the Hero
doesn’t face actual death, then there is the threat of death or symbolic
death in the form of a high-stakes game, love affair, or adventure in
which the Hero may succeed (live) or fail (die).
Heroes show us how to deal with death. They may survive it,
proving that death is not so tough. They may die (perhaps only symbolically) and be reborn, proving that death can be transcended. They
may die a Hero's death, transcending death by offering up their lives
willingly for a cause, an ideal, or a group.
34
HERO
‘True heroism is shown in stories when Heroes offer themselves
on the altar of chance, willing to take the risk that their quest for
adventure may lead to danger, loss, or death. Like soldiers who know
that by enlisting they have agreed to give their lives if their country
asks them to, Heroes accept the possibility of sacrifice.
Heroes may experience sacrifice by giving up a loved one or friend
along the way. They may give up some cherished vice or eccentricity as
the price of entering into a new way of life. They may return some of
their winnings or share what they have gained in the Special World.
They may return to their starting point, the tribe or village, and bring
back boons, elixirs, food, or knowledge to share with the rest of the
group. Great cultural Heroes like Martin Luther King or Gandhi gave
their lives in pursuit of their ideals.
HEROISM IN OTHER ARCHETYPES
Sometimes the Hero archetype is not just manifested in the main
character, the protagonist who bravely fights the bad guys and wins.
The archetype can be manifested in other characters, when they act
heroically. An unheroic character can grow to be heroic. The title character of Gunga Din begins as another archetype altogether, a trickster
or clown, but by striving to be a Hero, and by sacrificing himself at a
crucial moment on behalf of his friends, he earns the right to be called
a Hero. In Star Wars, Obi Wan Kenobi clearly manifests the archetype
of the mentor through most of the story. However, he acts heroically
and temporarily wears the mask of the Hero when he sacrifices himself to allow Luke to escape the Death Star.
It can be very effective to have a villainous or antagonistic character unexpectedly manifest heroic qualities. On the sitcom level,
when a character like Danny DeVito’s despicable “Taxi” dispatcher
Louie suddenly reveals he has a soft heart or has done something
noble, the episode wins an Emmy. A gallant villain, heroic in some
ways and despicable in others, can be very appealing. Ideally, every
35
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
well-rounded character should manifest a touch of every archetype,
because the archetypes are expressions of the parts that make up a
complete personality.
CHARAGTER.FLAWS
Interesting flaws humanize a character. We can recognize bits of ourselves in a Hero who is challenged to overcome inner doubts, errors
in thinking, guilt or trauma from the past, or fear of the future. Weaknesses, imperfections, quirks, and vices immediately make a Hero
or any character more real and appealing. It seems the more neurotic characters are, the more the audience likes them and identifies
with them.
Flaws also give a character somewhere to go — the so-called
“character arc” in which a character develops from condition A to
condition Z through a series of steps. Flaws are a starting point of
imperfection or incompleteness from which a character can grow.
They may be deficiencies in a character. Perhaps a Hero has no romantic partner, and is looking for the “missing piece” to complete her life.
This is often symbolized in fairy tales by having the Hero experience
a loss or a death in the family. Many fairy tales begin with the death
of a parent or the kidnapping of a brother or sister. This subtraction
from the family unit sets the nervous energy of the story in motion,
not to stop until the balance has been restored by the creation of a
new family or the reuniting of the old.
In most modern stories it is the Hero's personality that is being
re-created or restored to wholeness. The missing piece may be a critical element of personality such as the ability to love or trust. Heroes
may have to overcome some problem such as lack of patience or decisiveness. Audiences love watching Heroes grapple with personality
problems and overcome them. Will Edward, the rich but cold-hearted
businessman of Pretty Woman, warm up under the influence of the
life-loving Vivian and become her Prince Charming? Will Vivian gain
36
HERO
some self-respect and escape her life of prostitution? Will Conrad,
the guilt-ridden teenager in Ordinary People, regain his lost ability to
accept love and intimacy?
VARIETIES OF HERO
Heroes come in many varieties, including willing and unwilling
Heroes, group-oriented and loner Heroes, Anti-heroes, tragic Heroes,
and catalyst Heroes. Like all the other archetypes, the Hero is a flexible concept that can express many kinds of energy. Heroes may
combine with other archetypes to produce hybrids like the Trickster
Hero, or they may temporarily wear the mask of another archetype,
becoming a Shapeshifter, a Mentor to someone else, or even a Shadow.
Although usually portrayed as a positive figure, the Hero may
also express dark or negative sides of the ego. The Hero archetype
generally represents the human spirit in positive action, but may also
show the consequences of weakness and reluctance to act.
WILLING AND UNWILLING HEROES
It seems Heroes are of two types: 1) willing, active, gung-ho, committed to the adventure, without doubts, always bravely going ahead,
self-motivated, or 2) unwilling, full of doubts and hesitations, passive, needing to be motivated or pushed into the adventure by outside
forces. Both make equally entertaining stories, although a Hero who
is passive throughout may make for an uninvolving dramatic experience. It’s usually best for an unwilling Hero to change at some point,
to become committed to the adventure after some necessary motivation has been supplied.
ANTI-HEROES
Anti-hero is a slippery term that can cause a lot of confusion. Simply
stated, an Anti-hero is not the opposite of a Hero, but a specialized
kind of Hero, one who may be an outlaw or a villain from the point of
37
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
view of society, but with whom the audience is basically in sympathy.
We identify with these outsiders because we have all felt like outsiders at one time or another.
Anti-heroes may be of two types: 1) characters who behave much
like conventional Heroes, but are given a strong touch of cynicism or
have a wounded quality, like Bogart’s characters in The Big Sleep and
Casablanca, or 2) tragic Heroes, central figures of a story who may
not be likeable or admirable, whose actions we may even deplore,
like Macbeth or Scarface or the Joan Crawford of Mommie Dearest.
The wounded Anti-hero may be a heroic knight in tarnished
armor, a loner who has rejected society or been rejected by it. These
characters may win at the end and may have the audience’s full sympathy at all times, but in society’s eyes they are outcasts, like Robin
Hood, roguish pirate or bandit Heroes, or many of Bogart’s characters. They are often honorable men who have withdrawn from
society's corruption, perhaps ex-cops or soldiers who became disillusioned and now operate in the shadow of the law as private eyes,
smugglers, gamblers, or soldiers of fortune. We love these characters
because they are rebels, thumbing their noses at society as we would
all like to do. Another archetype of this kind is personified in James
Dean in Rebel Without a Cause and East of Eden, or the young Marlon
Brando, whose character in The Wild One acted out a new and quite
different generation's dissatisfaction with the old. Actors like Mickey
Rourke, Matt Dillon, and Sean Penn carry on the tradition today.
The second type of Anti-hero is more like the classical idea of the
tragic Hero. These are flawed Heroes who never overcome their inner
demons and are brought down and destroyed by them. They may be
charming, they may have admirable qualities, but the flaw wins out in
the end. Some tragic Anti-heroes are not so admirable, but we watch
their downfall with fascination because “there, but for the grace of
God, go I.” Like the ancient Greeks who watched Oedipus fall, we
are purged of our emotions and we learn to avoid the same pitfalls as
38
HERO
we watch the destruction of Al Pacino’s character in Scarface, Sigourney Weaver as Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist, or Diane Keaton’s
character in Looking for Mr. Goodbar.
GROUP-ORIENTED HEROES
Another distinction must be made about Heroes with respect to their
orientation to society. Like the first storytellers, the earliest humans
who went out hunting and gathering on the plains of Africa, most
Heroes are group-oriented: They are part of a society at the beginning of the story, and their journey takes them to an unknown land
far from home. When we first meet them, they are part of a clan,
tribe, village, town, or family. Their story is one of separation from
that group (Act One); lone adventure in the wilderness away from
the group (Act Two); and usually, eventual reintegration with the
group (Act Three).
Group-oriented Heroes often face a choice between returning
to the Ordinary World of the first act or remaining in the Special
World of the second act. Heroes who choose to remain in the Special
World are rare in Western culture but fairly common in classic Asian
and Indian tales.
LONER HEROES
In contrast to the group-oriented Hero is the loner Western Hero
such as Shane, Clint Eastwood’s Man with No Name, John Wayne's
Ethan in The Searchers, or The Lone Ranger. With this Hero type, the
stories begin with the Heroes estranged from society. Their natural
habitat is the wilderness, their natural state is solitude. Their journey
is one of re-entry into the group (Act One); adventure within the
group, on the group’s normal turf (Act Two); and return to isolation
in the wilderness (Act Three). For them the Special World of Act
Two is the tribe or village, which they visit briefly but in which they
are always uncomfortable. The wonderful shot of John Wayne at the
39
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
end of The Searchers sums up the energy of this Hero type. Wayne is
framed in a cabin doorway as an outsider forever cut off from the joys
and comforts of the family. This kind of Hero need not be limited to
Westerns. It can be used effectively in dramas or action movies where
a loner detective is tempted back into adventure, where a hermit or
retired person is called back into society, or where an emotionally
isolated person is challenged to re-enter the world of relationships.
As with group-oriented Heroes, the loner Heroes have the final
choice of returning to their initial state (solitude), or remaining in the
Special World of Act Two. Some Heroes begin as loners and end as
group-oriented Heroes who elect to stay with the group.
CATALYST HEROES
A certain class of Hero is an exception to the rule that the Hero is usually the character who undergoes the most change. These are catalyst
Heroes, central figures who may act heroically, but who do not change
much themselves because their main function is to bring about transformation in others. Like a true catalyst in chemistry, they bring about
a change in a system without being changed themselves.
A good example is Eddie Murphy’s character Axel Foley from
Beverly Hills Cop. His personality is already fully formed and distinctive at the story’s beginning. He doesn’t have much of a character arc
because he has nowhere to go. He doesn’t learn or change much in
the course of the story, but he does bring about change in his Beverly Hills cop buddies, Taggart and Rosewood. By comparison they
have relatively strong character arcs, from being uptight and by-thebook to being hip and streetwise, thanks to Axel’s influence. In fact,
although Axel is the central figure, the villain’s main opponent, and
the character with the best lines and the most screen time, it could
be argued that he is not the true Hero, but the Mentor of the piece,
while young Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is the actual Hero because
he learns the most.

HERO
Catalyst Heroes are especially useful in continuing stories such as
episodic TV shows and sequels. Like The Lone Ranger or Superman,
these Heroes undergo few internal changes, but primarily act to help
others or guide them in their growth. Of course it’s a good idea once
in a while to give even these characters some moments of growth and
change to help keep them fresh and believable.
THE ROAD OF HEROES
Heroes are symbols of the soul in transformation, and of the journey
each person takes through life. The stages of that progression, the natural stages of life and growth, make up the Hero’s Journey. The Hero
archetype is a rich field for exploration by writers and spiritual seekers.
Carol S. Pearson’s book Awakening the Heroes Within farther breaks
down the idea of the Hero into useful archetypes (Innocent, Orphan,
Martyr, Wanderer, Warrior, Caregiver, Seeker, Lover, Destroyer, Creator, Ruler, Magician, Sage, and Fool) and graphs the emotional
progress of each. It’s a good guide to a deeper psychological understanding of the Hero in its many facets. The special avenues traveled
by some female heroes are described in The Heroine’s Journey: Woman’
Quest for Wholeness by Maureen Murdock.

MENTOR:
WISE OLD MAN OR WOMAN
&
“May the Force be with you!”
— from Star Wars by George Lucas
n archetype found frequently in dreams, myths,
and stories is the Mentor, usually a positive figure who aids or trains the hero. Campbell’s
name for this force is the Wise Old Man or
Wise Old Woman. This archetype is expressed
in all those characters who teach and protect heroes and give them
gifts. Whether it’s God walking with Adam in the Garden of Eden,
Merlin guiding King Arthur, the Fairy Godmother helping Cinderella, or a veteran sergeant giving advice to a rookie cop, the
relationship between hero and Mentor is one of the richest sources
of entertainment in literature and film.
The word “Mentor” comes to us from The Odyssey. A character named Mentor guides the young hero, Telemachus, on his Hero's
Journey. In fact it’s the goddess Athena who helps Telemachus, by
assuming the form of Mentor. (See Chapter 4 in book two for a fuller
discussion of Mentor’s role.) Mentors often speak in the voice of a
43
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
god, or are inspired by divine wisdom. Good teachers and Mentors
are enthused, in the original sense of the word. “Enthusiasm” is from
the Greek en theos, meaning god-inspired, having a god in you, or
being in the presence of a god.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION
In the anatomy of the human psyche, Mentors represent the Self, the
god within us, the aspect of personality that is connected with all
things. This higher Self is the wiser, nobler, more godlike part of us.
Like Jiminy Cricket in the Disney version of Pinocchio, the Self acts
as a conscience to guide us on the road of life when no Blue Fairy or
kindly Geppetto is there to protect us and tell us right from wrong.
Mentor figures, whether encountered in dreams, fairy tales,
myths, or screenplays, stand for the hero’s highest aspirations. They
are what the hero may become if she persists on the Road of Heroes.
Mentors are often former heroes who have survived life’s early trials
and are now passing on the gift of their knowledge and wisdom.
The Mentor archetype is closely related to the image of the
parent. The fairy godmother in stories such as “Cinderella” can be
interpreted as the protecting spirit of the girl’s dead mother. Merlin
is a surrogate parent to the young King Arthur, whose father is dead.
Many heroes seek out Mentors because their own parents are inadequate role models.
DRAMATIC FUNCTIONS
TEACHING
Just as learning is an important function of the hero, teaching or
training is a key function of the Mentor. Training sergeants, drill
instructors, professors, trail bosses, parents, grandparents, crusty old
boxing coaches, and all those who teach a hero the ropes, are manifesting this archetype. Of course the teaching can go both ways. Anyone
44
MENTOR
who has taught knows that you learn as much from your students as
they do from you.
GIFT-GIVING
Giving gifts is also an important function of this archetype. In Vladimir Propp’s analysis of Russian fairy tales, Morphology of the Folktale,
he identifies this function as that of a “donor” or provider: one who
temporarily aids the hero, usually by giving some gift. It may be a
magic weapon, an important key or clue, some magical medicine or
food, or a life-saving piece of advice. In fairy tales the donor might be
a witch’s cat, grateful for a little girl’s kindness, who gives her a towel
and a comb. Later when the girl is being chased by the witch, the towel
turns into a raging river and the comb turns into a forest to block the
witch’s pursuit.
Examples of these gifts are abundant in movies, from the smalltime mobster Putty Nose giving James Cagney his first gun in The
Public Enemy to Obi Wan Kenobi giving Luke Skywalker his father’s
lightsaber. Nowadays the gift is as likely to be a computer code as the
key to a dragon's lair.
GIFTS INMYTHOLOGY
Gift-giving, the donor function of the Mentor, has an important role
in mythology. Many heroes received gifts from their Mentors, the
gods. Pandora, whose name means “all-gifted,” was showered with
presents, including Zeus’s vindictive gift of the box which she was
not supposed to open. Heroes such as Hercules were given some gifts
by their Mentors, but among the Greeks the most gifted of heroes
was Perseus.
PERSEUS
The Greek ideal of heroism was expressed in Perseus, the monsterslayer. He has the distinction of being one of the best equipped of
45
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
heroes, so loaded down with gifts from higher powers that it’s a wonder he could walk. In time, with the help of Mentors such as Hermes
and Athena, he acquired winged sandals, a magic sword, a helmet of
invisibility, a magic sickle, a magic mirror, the head of Medusa that
turned all who look upon it to stone, and a magic satchel to stow the
head in. As if this were not enough, the movie version of the Perseus
tale, Clash of the Titans, gives him the flying horse Pegasus as well.
In most stories, this would be overdoing it a bit. But Perseus is
meant to be a paragon of heroes, so it’s fitting he should be so well
provided for by the gods, his Mentors in the quest.
GIFTS SHOULD BE EARNED
In Propp’s dissection of Russian fairy tales, he observes that donor
characters give magical presents to heroes, but usually only after the
heroes have passed a test of some kind. This is a good rule of thumb:
The gift or help of the donor should be earned, by learning, sacrifice, or commitment. Fairy-tale heroes eventually earn the aid of
animals or magical creatures by being kind to them in the beginning,
sharing food with them, or protecting them from harm.
MENTOR AS INVENTOR
Sometimes the Mentor functions as a scientist or inventor, whose gifts
are his devices, designs, or inventions. The great inventor of classical
myth is Daedalus, who designed the Labyrinth and other wonders
for the rulers of Crete. As the master artisan of the Theseus and the
Minotaur story, he had a hand in creating the monster Minotaur and
designed the Labyrinth as a cage for it. As a Mentor, Daedalus gave
Ariadne the ball of thread that allowed Theseus to get in and out of
the Labyrinth alive.
Imprisoned in his own maze as punishment for helping Theseus, Daedalus also invented the famous wax-and-feather wings that
allowed him and his son Icarus to escape. As a Mentor to Icarus, he
46
MENTOR
The Mentor may act as a conscience for the Hero.
advised his son not to fly too close to the sun. Icarus, who had grown
up in the pitch dark of the Labyrinth, was irresistibly attracted to the
sun, ignored his father’s advice, and fell to his death when the wax
melted. The best advice is worthless if you don’t take it.
THE HERO’S CONSCIENCE
Some Mentors perform a special function as a conscience for the
hero. Characters like Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio or Walter Brennan's
Groot in Red River try to remind an errant hero of an important
moral code. However, a hero may rebel against a nagging conscience.
Would-be Mentors should remember that in the original Collodi
story Pinocchio squashed the cricket to shut him up. The angel on a
hero’s shoulder can never offer arguments as colorful as those of the
devil on the opposite side.
MOTIVATION
Another important function of the Mentor archetype is to motivate
the hero, and help her overcome fear. Sometimes the gift alone is sufficient reassurance and motivation. In other cases the Mentor shows
47
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
the hero something or arranges things to motivate her to take action
and commit to the adventure.
In some cases, a hero is so unwilling or fearful that he must be
pushed into the adventure. A Mentor may need to give a hero a swift
kick in the pants in order to get the adventure rolling.
PLANTING
A function of the Mentor archetype is often to plant information or
a prop that will become important later. The James Bond films have
a mandatory scene in which the weapons master “Q,’ one of Bond’s
recurring Mentors, describes the workings of some new briefcase gadget to a bored 007. This information is a plant, meant for the audience
to note but forget about until the climactic moment where the gadget
becomes a lifesaver. Such constructions help tie the beginning and end
of the story together, and show that at some point everything we've
learned from our Mentors comes in handy.
SEXUAL INITIATION
In the realm of love, the Mentor’s function may be to initiate us into
the mysteries of love or sex. In India they speak of the Shakti — a sexual initiator, a partner who helps you experience the power of sex as
a vehicle of higher consciousness. A Shakti is a manifestation of God,
a Mentor leading the lover to experience the divine.
Seducers and thieves of innocence teach heroes lessons the hard
way. [here may be a shadow side to Mentors who lead a hero down a
dangerous road of obsessive love or loveless, manipulative sex. There
are Many ways to learn.
TYPES OF MENTOR
Like heroes, Mentors may be willing or unwilling. Sometimes they
teach in spite of themselves. In other cases they teach by their bad
example. The downfall of a weakened, tragically flawed Mentor can
48
MENTOR
show the hero pitfalls to avoid. As with heroes, dark or negative sides
may be expressed through this archetype.
DARK MENTORS
In certain stories, the power of the Mentor archetype can be used to
mislead the audience. In thrillers the mask of a Mentor is sometimes a
decoy used to lure the hero into danger. Or in an anti-heroic gangster
picture such as The Public Enemy or Goodfellas, where every conventional heroic value is inverted, an Anti-mentor appears to guide the
Anti-hero on the road to crime and destruction.
Another inversion of this archetype’s energy is a special kind of
Threshold Guardian (an archetype discussed in the next chapter). An
example is found in Romancing the Stone, where Joan Wilder’s witchy,
sharp-tongued agent is to all appearances a Mentor, guiding her career
and giving her advice about men. But when Joan is about to cross the
threshold to adventure, the agent tries to stop her, warning her of the
dangers and casting doubt in her mind. Rather than motivating her
like a true Mentor, the agent becomes an obstacle in the hero's path.
This is psychologically true to life, for often we must overcome or
outgrow the energy of our best teachers in order to move to the next
stage of development.
FALLEN MENTORS
Some Mentors are still on a Hero’s Journey of their own. They may be
experiencing a crisis of faith in their calling. Perhaps they are dealing
with the problems of aging and approaching the threshold of death,
or have fallen from the hero’s road. The hero needs the Mentor to pull
himself together one more time, and there’s serious doubt that he can
do it. Tom Hanks in _4 League of Their Own plays a former sports hero
sidelined by injury and making a poor transition into Mentor-hood.
He has fallen far from grace, and the audience is rooting for him to
straighten up and honor his task of helping the heroes. Such a Mentor
49
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
may go through all the stages of a hero’s journey, on his own path to
redemption.
CONTINUING MENTORS
Mentors are useful for giving assignments and setting stories in
motion. For this reason they are often written into the cast of continuing stories. Recurring Mentors include Mr. Waverly on “The
Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” “M” in the Bond pictures, the Chief on “Get
Smart,” Will Geer and Ellen Corby as the grandparents on “The Waltons,” Alfred in “Batman,” James Earl Jones’s CIA official in Patriot
Games and The Hunt for Red October, etc.
MULTIPLE MENTORS
A hero may be trained by a series of Mentors who teach specific skills.
Hercules is surely among the best trained of heroes, mentored by
experts on wrestling, archery, horsemanship, weapon-handling, boxing, wisdom, virtue, song, and music. He even took a driver-training
course in charioteering from one Mentor. All of us have learned from a
series of Mentors, including parents, older brothers and sisters, friends,
lovers, teachers, bosses, co-workers, therapists, and other role models.
Multiple Mentors may be needed to express different functions
of the archetype. In the James Bond movies, 007 always returns to his
home base to confer with his main Wise Old Man or Woman, the spymaster “M” who gives him assignments, advice, and warnings. But the
Mentor function of giving gifts to the hero is delegated to “Q,” the
weapons and gadget master. A certain amount of emotional support
as well as advice and critical information is provided by Miss Moneypenny, representing another aspect of the Mentor.
COMIC MENTORS
A special type of Mentor occurs in romantic comedies. This person
is often the friend or fellow office worker of the hero, and is usually
50
MENTOR
of the same gender as the hero. She gives the hero some advice about
love: go out more to forget the pain of a lost love; pretend to have
an affair to make your husband jealous; feign interest in the beloved’s
hobbies; impress the beloved with gifts, flowers, or flattery; be more
aggressive; and so on. The advice often seems to lead the hero into
temporary disaster, but it all turns out right in the end. These characters are a feature of romantic comedies, especially those of the 1950s
when movies like Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back gave plenty of
work for character actors like Thelma Ritter and Tony Randall who
could portray this wisecracking, sarcastic version of a Mentor.
MENTOR AS SHAMAN
Mentor figures in stories are closely related to the idea of the shaman: the healer, the medicine man or woman, of tribal cultures. Just
as Mentors guide the hero through the Special World, shamans guide
their people through life. They travel to other worlds in dreams and
visions and bring back stories to heal their tribes. It’s often the function of a Mentor to help the hero seek a guiding vision for a quest to
another world.
FLEXIBILITY OF THE MENTOR ARCHETYPE
Like the other archetypes, the Mentor or donor is not a rigid character type, but rather a function, a job which several different characters
might perform in the course of a story. A character primarily manifesting one archetype — the hero, the shapeshifter, the trickster, even the
villain — may temporarily slip on the mask of the Mentor in order to
teach or give something to the hero.
In Russian fairy tales, the wonderful character of the witch Baba
Yaga is a Shadow figure who sometimes wears the Mentor mask. On
the surface she’s a horrible, cannibalistic witch representing the dark
side of the forest, its power to devour. But like the forest, she can be
appeased and can shower gifts on the traveler. Sometimes if Prince
51
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Ivan is kind and complimentary to her, Baba Yaga gives him the magical treasure he needs to rescue the Princess Vasilisa.
Although Campbell called these Mentor figures Wise Old Men
or Women, they are sometimes neither wise nor old. The young,
in their innocence, are often wise and capable of teaching the old.
The most foolish person in a story might be the one we learn the
most from. As with the other archetypes, the function of a Mentor
is more important than mere physical description. What the character does will often determine what archetype is being manifested at
the moment.
Many stories have no specific character who can be identified
as a Mentor. There’s no white-bearded, wizardly figure who wanders
around acting like a Wise Old Man. Nevertheless, almost every story
calls on the energy of this archetype at some point.
INNER MENTORS
In some Westerns or film noir stories the hero is an experienced,
hardened character who has no need for a Mentor or guide. He has
internalized the archetype and it now lives within him as an inner
code of behavior. The Mentor may be the unspoken code of the gunfighter, or the secret notions of honor harbored by Sam Spade or
Philip Marlowe. A code of ethics may be a disembodied manifestation
of the Mentor archetype guiding the hero’s actions. It’s not uncommon for a hero to make reference to a Mentor who meant something
to him earlier in life, even if there’s no actual Mentor character in the
story. A hero may remember, “My mother/father/grandfather/drill
sergeant used to say...” and then call to mind the bit of wisdom that
will become critical in solving the problem of the story. The energy of
the Mentor archetype also may be invested in a prop such as a book
or other artifact that guides the hero in the quest.
52
MENTOR
PLACEMENT OF MENTORS
Although the Hero’s Journey often finds the Mentor appearing in Act
One, the placement of a Mentor in a story is a practical consideration.
A character may be needed at any point who knows the ropes, has the
map to the unknown country, or can give the hero key information
at the right time. Mentors may show up early in a story, or wait in the
wings until needed at a critical moment in Act Two or Act Three.
Mentors provide heroes with motivation, inspiration, guidance,
training, and gifts for the journey. Every hero is guided by something,
and a story without some acknowledgment of this energy is incomplete. Whether expressed as an actual character or as an internalized
code of behavior, the Mentor archetype is a powerful tool at the writer’s command.

THRESHOLD GUARDIAN
ee
‘L, for one, have an idea that he will
never bring this Journey off.”
— The Odyssey of Homer
ll heroes encounter obstacles on the road to
adventure. At each gateway to a new world
there are powerful guardians at the threshold,
SR PE [I] placed to keep the unworthy from entering.
SSE They present a menacing face to the hero, but if
properly understood, they can be overcome, bypassed, or even turned
into allies. Many heroes (and many writers) encounter Threshold
Guardians, and understanding their nature can help determine how
to handle them.
Threshold Guardians are usually not the main villains or antagonists in stories. Often they will be lieutenants of the villain, lesser
thugs or mercenaries hired to guard access to the chief’s headquarters.
They may also be neutral figures who are simply part of the landscape
of the Special World. In rare cases they may be secret helpers placed
in the hero’s path to test her willingness and skill.
There is often a symbiotic relationship between a villain and a
Threshold Guardian. In nature, a powerful animal such as a bear will
55
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
sometimes tolerate a smaller animal such as a fox nesting at the entrance
of its lair. The fox, with its strong smell and sharp teeth, tends to keep
other animals from wandering into the cave while the bear is sleeping.
The fox also serves as an early warning system for the bear by making a
racket if something tries to enter the cave. In similar fashion, villains of
stories often rely on underlings such as doorkeepers, bouncers, bodyguards, sentries, gunslingers, or mercenaries to protect and warn them
when a hero approaches the Threshold of the villain’s stronghold.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION: NEUROSES
These Guardians may represent the ordinary obstacles we all face in
the world around us: bad weather, bad luck, prejudice, oppression, or
hostile people like the waitress who refuses to grant Jack Nicholson’s
simple request in Five Easy Pieces. But on a deeper psychological level
they stand for our internal demons: the neuroses, emotional scars, vices,
dependencies, and self-limitations that hold back our growth and progress. It seems that every time you try to make a major change in your life,
these inner demons rise up to their full force, not necessarily to stop you,
but to test if you are really determined to accept the challenge of change.
DRAMATIC FUNCTION: TESTING
Testing of the hero is the primary dramatic function of the Threshold
Guardian. When heroes confront one of these figures, they must solve
a puzzle or pass a test. Like the Sphinx who presents Oedipus with a
riddle before he can continue his journey, Threshold Guardians challenge and test heroes on the path.
How to deal with these apparent obstacles? Heroes have a range
of options. They can turn around and run, attack the opponent headon, use craft or deceit to get by, bribe or appease the Guardian, or
make an Ally of a presumed enemy. (Heroes are aided by a variety of
archetypes known collectively as Allies, which will be discussed in a
separate chapter.)
THRESHOLD GUARDIAN
One of the most effective ways of dealing with a Threshold Guardian is to “get into the skin” of the opponent, like a hunter entering into
the mind of a stalked animal. The Plains Indians wore buffalo skins
to sneak within bow-shot of the bison herd. The hero may get past a
Threshold Guardian by entering into its spirit or taking on its appearance. A good example is in Act Two of The Wizard of Oz, when the
Tin Woodsman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow come to the Wicked
Witch's castle to rescue the kidnapped Dorothy. The situation looks
bleak. Dorothy’s inside a strong castle defended by a regiment of fiercelooking soldiers who march up and down singing “Oh-Ee-Oh.” There’s
no possible way for the three friends to defeat such a large force.
However, our heroes are ambushed by three sentries and overcome them, taking their uniforms and weapons. Disguised as soldiers,
they join the end of a column and march right into the castle. They
have turned an attack to their advantage by literally climbing into the
skins of their opponents. Instead of uselessly trying to defeat a superior enemy, they have temporarily become the enemy.
It’s important for a hero to recognize and acknowledge these
figures as Threshold Guardians. In daily life, you have probably
encountered resistance when you try to make a positive change in
your life. People around you, even those who love you, are often reluctant to see you change. They are used to your neuroses and have found
ways to benefit from them. The idea of your changing may threaten
them. If they resist you, it’s important to realize they are simply functioning as Threshold Guardians, testing you to see if you are really
resolved to change.
SIGNALS OF NEW POWER
Successful heroes learn to recognize Threshold Guardians not as
threatening enemies, but as useful Allies and early indicators that
new power or success is coming. Threshold Guardians who appear to
be attacking may in fact be doing the hero a huge favor.
57
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Heroes also learn to recognize resistance as a source of strength.
As in bodybuilding, the greater the resistance, the greater the strength.
Rather than attacking the power of Threshold Guardians head-on,
heroes learn to use it so it doesn’t harm them. In fact it makes them
stronger. The martial arts teach that an opponent's strength can be
used against him. Ideally, Threshold Guardians are not to be defeated
but incorporated (literally, taken into the body). Heroes learn the
Guardians’ tricks, absorb them, and go on. Ultimately, fully evolved
heroes feel compassion for their apparent enemies and transcend
rather than destroy them.
Heroes must learn to read the signals of their Threshold Guardians. In The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell illustrated this idea
beautifully with an example from Japan. Ferocious-looking demon
statues sometimes guard the entrances to Japanese temples. The first
thing you notice is one hand held up like that of a policeman gesturing
“Stop!” But when you look more closely, you see that the other hand
invites you to enter. The message is: Those who are put off by outward
appearances cannot enter the Special World, but those who can see
past surface impressions to the inner reality are welcome.
oe
In stories, Threshold Guardians take on a fantastic array of forms.
They may be border guards, sentinels, night watchmen, lookouts,
bodyguards, bandidos, editors, doormen, bouncers, entrance examiners, or anyone whose function is to temporarily block the way of the
hero and test her powers. The energy of the Threshold Guardian may
not be embodied as a character, but may be found as a prop, architectural feature, animal, or force of nature that blocks and tests the hero.
Learning how to deal with Threshold Guardians is one of the major
tests of the Hero's Journey.

HERALD
ee
‘Tf you build it, they will come.”
— The Voice in Field of Dreams, screenplay
by Phil Alden Robinson from the novel
Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella
ften a new force will appear in Act One to bring
a challenge to the hero. This is the energy of the
Herald archetype. Like the heralds of medieval
chivalry, Herald characters issue challenges and
announce the coming of significant change.
The heralds of knighthood were responsible for keeping track of lineages and coats of arms, and had an
important role in identifying people and relationships in battle, tournaments, and on great state occasions such as weddings. They were
the protocol officers of their day. At the commencement of war a herald might be called upon to recite the causes of the conflict; in effect,
to provide the motivation. In Shakespeare’s Henry V, the Ambassadors from the Dauphin (crown prince) of France act as Heralds when
they bring the young English king an insulting gift of tennis balls,
which implies King Henry is fit for nothing but a frivolous game
of tennis. The appearance of these Heralds is the spark that sets off
a war. Later the character of Montjoy, the Dauphin’s Herald, bears
61
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
messages between King Henry and his master during the crucial battle of Agincourt.
Typically, in the opening phase of a story, heroes have “gotten
by” somehow. They have handled an imbalanced life through a series
of defenses or coping mechanisms. Then all at once some new energy
enters the story that makes it impossible for the hero to simply get by
any longer. A new person, condition, or information shifts the hero’s
balance, and nothing will ever be the same. A decision must be made,
action taken, the conflict faced. A Call to Adventure has been delivered, often by a character who manifests the archetype of the Herald.
Heralds are so necessary in mythology that the Greek god
Hermes (Roman Mercury) is devoted to expressing this function.
Hermes appears everywhere as the messenger or Herald of the gods,
performing some errand or bearing a message from Zeus. At the
beginning of The Odyssey Hermes, at Athena’s urging, bears a message from Zeus to the nymph Calypso that she must release Odysseus.
The appearance of Hermes as Herald gets the story rolling.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION: CALL FOR CHANGE
Heralds have the important psychological function of announcing
the need for change. Something deep inside us knows when we are
ready to change and sends us a messenger. This may be a dream figure, a real person, or a new idea we encounter. In Field of Dreams it’s
the mysterious Voice that the hero hears saying, “If you build it, they
will come.” The Call might come from a book we read, or a movie we
see. But something inside us has been struck like a bell, and the resulting vibrations spread out through our lives until change is inevitable.
DRAMATIC FUNCTION: MOTIVATION
Heralds provide motivation, offer the hero a challenge, and get the
story rolling. They alert the hero (and the audience) that change and
adventure are coming.
62
HERALD
An example of the Herald archetype as a motivator in movies can
be found in Alfred Hitchcock’s Notorious. Cary Grant plays a secret
agent trying to enlist Ingrid Bergman, the playgirl daughter of a Nazi
spy, in a noble cause. He offers her both a challenge and an opportunity: She can overcome her bad reputation and the family shame by
dedicating herself to Cary’s noble cause. (The cause turns out to be
not so noble later on, but that’s another story.)
Like most heroes, Bergman’s character is fearful of change and
reluctant to accept the challenge, but Grant, like a medieval herald,
reminds her of the past and gives her motivation to act. He plays her
a recording of an argument she had with her father, in which she
renounced his spying and declared her loyalty to the United States.
Confronted by the evidence of her own patriotism, she accepts the
call to adventure. She is motivated.
The Herald may be a person or a force. The coming of a storm or
the first tremors of the earth, as in Hurricane or Earthquake, may be
the Herald of adventure. The crash of the stock market or the declaration of war have set many a story in motion.
Often the Herald is simply a means of bringing news to the hero
of a new energy that will change the balance. It could be a telegram or
a phone call. In High Noon, the Herald is a telegraph clerk who brings
Gary Cooper word that his enemies are out of jail and headed for
town to kill him. In Romancing the Stone, the Herald for Joan Wilder
is a treasure map that arrives in the mail, and a phone call from her
sister, who is being held hostage in Colombia.
TYPES OF HERALD
The Herald may be a positive, negative, or neutral figure. In some stories the Herald is the villain or his emissary, perhaps issuing a direct
challenge to the hero, or trying to dupe the hero into getting involved.
In the thriller Arabesque, the Herald is the private secretary of the villain who tries to lure the hero, a college professor of modest means,
63
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY

into danger with a tempting offer of work. In some cases, a villainous
Herald may announce the challenge not to the hero but to the audience. In Star Wars the first appearance of Darth Vader, as he captures
Princess Leia, proclaims to the audience that something is out of balance before the hero, Luke Skywalker, has even appeared.
In other stories the Herald is an agent of the forces of good, calling the hero to a positive adventure. The Herald’s mask may be worn
temporarily by a character who mainly embodies some other archetype. A Mentor frequently acts as a Herald who issues a challenge to
the hero. The Herald may be a hero’s loved one or Ally, or someone
neutral to the hero, such as a Trickster or Threshold Guardian.
oe
The Herald archetype may come into play at almost any point in a
story, but is most frequently employed in Act One to help bring the
hero into the adventure. Whether it is an inner call, an external development, or a character bringing news of change, the energy of the
Herald is needed in almost every story.

“You can expect the unexpected.”
— publicity for the film Charade
eople often have trouble grasping the elusive
archetype of the Shapeshifter, perhaps because
its very nature is to be shifting and unstable. Its
appearance and characteristics change as soon
as you examine it closely. Nonetheless, the
Shapeshifter is a powerful archetype and understanding its ways can
be helpful in storytelling and in life.
Heroes frequently encounter figures whose primary characteristic is that they appear to change constantly from the hero’s point of
view. Often the hero’s love interest or romantic partner will manifest
the qualities of a Shapeshifter. We have all experienced relationships
in which our partner is fickle, two-faced, or bewilderingly changeable. In Fatal Attraction the hero is confronted with a Shapeshifting
woman who changes from a passionate lover to an insane, murderous harpy.
Shapeshifters change appearance or mood, and are difficult for
the hero and the audience to pin down. They may mislead the hero or
keep her guessing, and their loyalty or sincerity is often in question.
67
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
An Ally or friend of the same gender as the hero may also act as a
Shapeshifter in a buddy comedy or adventure. Wizards, witches, and
ogres are traditional Shapeshifters in the world of fairy tales.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION
An important psychological purpose of the Shapeshifter archetype
is to express the energy of the animus and anima, terms from the
psychology of Carl Jung. The animus is Jung’s name for the male element in the female unconscious, the bundle of positive and negative
images of masculinity in a woman’s dreams and fantasies. The anima
is the corresponding female element in the male unconscious. In this
theory, people have a complete set of both male and female qualities
which are necessary for survival and internal balance.
Historically, the female characteristics in men and the male characteristics in women have been sternly repressed by society. Men learn
at an early age to show only the macho, unemotional side of themselves. Women are taught by society to play down their masculine
qualities. This can lead to emotional and even physical problems. Men
are now working to regain some of their suppressed feminine qualities
— sensitivity, intuition, and the ability to feel and express emotion.
Women sometimes spend their adult lives trying to reclaim the male
energies within them which society has discouraged, such as power
and assertiveness.
These repressed qualities live within us and are manifested in
dreams and fantasies as the animus or anima. They may take the form
of dream characters such as opposite-sex teachers, family members,
classmates, gods, or monsters who allow us to express this unconscious
but powerful force within. An encounter with the anima or animus
in dreams or fantasy is considered an important step in psychological growth.
68
SHAPESHIFTER
PROJECTION
We may also confront the animus and anima in reality. By nature we
look for people who match our internal image of the ideal partner.
Often we imagine the resemblance and project onto some unsuspecting person our desire to join with the anima or animus. We may
fall into relationships in which we have not seen the partner clearly.
Instead we have seen the anima or animus, our own internal notion
of the ideal partner, projected onto the other person. We often go
through relationships trying to force the partner to match our projection. Hitchcock created a powerful expression of this phenomenon
in Vertigo. James Stewart forces Kim Novak to change her hair and
clothing to match the image of his feminine ideal Carlota, a woman
who ironically never existed in the first place.
It’s natural for each sex to regard the other as ever-changing,
mysterious. Many of us don’t understand our own sexuality and
psychology very well, let alone that of the opposite sex. Often our
main experience of the opposite sex is their changeability and their
tendency to shift attitudes, appearances, and emotions for no apparent reason.
Women complain that men are vague, vacillating, and unable to
commit. Men complain that women are moody, flighty, fickle, and
unpredictable. Anger can turn gentle men into beasts. Women change
dramatically during their monthly cycle, shifting with the phases of
the moon. During pregnancy they drastically shift shape and mood.
At some time most of us have been perceived by others as “two-faced”
Shapeshifters.
The animus and anima may be positive or negative figures who
may be helpful to the hero or destructive to him. In some stories it’s
the task of the hero to figure out which side, positive or negative, he
is dealing with.
The Shapeshifter archetype is also a catalyst for change, a symbol
of the psychological urge to transform. Dealing with a Shapeshifter
69
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
may cause the hero to change attitudes about the opposite sex or come
to terms with the repressed energies that this archetype stirs up.
These projections of our hidden opposite sides, these images and
ideas about sexuality and relationships, form the archetype of the
Shapeshifter.
DRAMATIC FUNCTION
The Shapeshifter serves the dramatic function of bringing doubt and
suspense into a story. When heroes keep asking, “Is he faithful to me?
Is she going to betray me? Does he truly love me? Is he an ally or an
enemy?” a Shapeshifter is generally present.
Shapeshifters appear with great frequency and variety in the film
noir and thriller genres. The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, and Chinatown feature detectives confronting Shapeshifting women whose loyalty
and motives are in doubt. In other stories such as Hitchcock’s Suspicion
or Shadow of a Doubt, a good woman must figure out if a Shapeshifting
man is worthy of her trust.
A common type of Shapeshifter is called the femme fatale, the
woman as temptress or destroyer. The idea is as old as the Bible, with
its stories of Eve in the Garden of Eden, the scheming Jezebel, and
Delilah cutting off Samson’s hair to rob him of his strength. The
femme fatale finds expression today in stories of cops and detectives
betrayed by killer women, such as Sharon Stone’s character in Basic
Instinct or Kathleen Turner’s in Body Heat. Black Widow and Single
White Female are interesting variants in which a female hero confronts
a deadly, Shapeshifting femme fatale.
The Shapeshifter, like the other archetypes, can be manifested
by male or female characters. There are as many hommes fatales
in myth, literature, and movies as there are femmes. In Greek
mythology, Zeus was a great Shapeshifter, changing forms to cavort
with human maidens who usually ended up suffering for it. Looking for Mr. Goodbar is about a woman seeking a perfect lover, but
70
SHAPESHIFTER
finding instead a Shapeshifting man who brings her death. The
film The Stranger depicts a good woman (Loretta Young) who is
about to marry a monstrous Shapeshifter, a closet Nazi played by
Orson Welles.
The fatale aspect is not always essential to this archetype. Shapeshifters may only dazzle and confuse the hero, rather than try to kill
her. Shapeshifting is a natural part of romance. It’s common to be
blinded by love, unable to see the other person clearly through the
many masks they wear. The character played by Michael Douglas in
Romancing the Stone appears to be a Shapeshifter to hero Kathleen
Turner, who is kept guessing until the last moment about the loyalty
of her male counterpart.
Shapeshifting may manifest in changes of appearance. In many
films a woman’s change of costume or hairstyle indicates that her
identity is shifting and her loyalty is in doubt. This archetype may
also be expressed through changes in behavior or speech, such as
assuming different accents or telling a succession of lies. In the
thriller Arabesque, Shapeshifter Sophia Loren tells unwilling hero
Gregory Peck a bewildering series of stories about her background,
all of which turn out be untrue. Many heroes have to deal with
Shapeshifters, male and female, who assume disguises and tell lies
to confuse them.
A famous Shapeshifter from The Odyssey is the sea god Proteus,
“the Old Man of the Sea.” Menelaus, one of the heroes returning from
the Trojan War, traps Proteus to force information out of him. Proteus changes into a lion, a snake, a panther, a boar, running water, and
a tree in his attempt to escape. But Menelaus and his men hold on
tight until Proteus returns to his true form and yields up the answers
to their questions. The story teaches that if heroes are patient with
Shapeshifters the truth may eventually come out. “Protean,’ our
adjective meaning “readily taking many forms,” comes from the story
of Proteus.
7]
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
MASK OF THE SHAPESHIFTER
As with the other archetypes, Shapeshifting is a function or a mask
that may be worn by any character in a story. A hero may wear the
mask in a romantic situation. Richard Gere, in An Officer and a
Gentleman, puts on airs and tells a hat-full of lies to impress Debra
Winger. He temporarily acts as a Shapeshifter although he is the hero
of the piece.
Sometimes a hero must become a Shapeshifter to escape a trap
or get past a Threshold Guardian. In Sister Act, Whoopi Goldberg's
character, a Las Vegas lounge singer, disguises herself as a Catholic nun
to keep from being killed as a witness to a mob murder.
Villains or their allies may wear the Shapeshifter mask to seduce
or confuse a hero. The wicked queen in Snow White assumes the form
of an old crone to trick the hero into eating a poisoned apple.
Shapeshifting is also a natural attribute of other archetypes such
as Mentors and Tricksters. Merlin, Mentor of the King Arthur stories,
frequently changes shape to aid Arthur’s cause. The goddess Athena
in The Odyssey assumes the appearance of many different humans to
help Odysseus and his son.
Shapeshifters can also be found in so-called “buddy movies” in
which the story centers on two male or two female characters who share
the role of hero. Often one is more conventionally heroic and easier for
the audience to identify with. The second character, while of the same
gender as the main hero, will often be a Shapeshifter, whose loyalty
and true nature are always in question. In the comedy The In-Laws, the
“straight” hero, Alan Arkin, is nearly driven crazy by the Shapeshifting
of his buddy, Peter Falk, a CIA agent.
72;
SHAPESHIFTER
&
The Shapeshifter is one of the most flexible archetypes and serves a
protean variety of functions in modern stories. It’s found most often
in romantic relationships, but it may also be useful in other situations
to portray characters whose appearance or behavior changes to meet
the needs of the story.

SHADOW
we
“You can't keep a good monster down!”
— publicity for Ghost of Frankenstein
he archetype known as the Shadow represents
the energy of the dark side, the unexpressed,
unrealized, or rejected aspects of something.
Often, it’s the home of the suppressed monsters of our inner world. Shadows can be all
the things we don’t like about ourselves, all the dark secrets we can’t
admit, even to ourselves. The qualities we have renounced and tried
to root out still lurk within, operating in the Shadow world of the
unconscious. The Shadow can also shelter positive qualities that are
in hiding or that we have rejected for some reason.
The negative face of the Shadow in stories is projected onto
characters called villains, antagonists, or enemies. Villains and enemies are usually dedicated to the death, destruction, or defeat of the
hero. Antagonists may not be quite so hostile — they may be Allies
who are after the same goal but who disagree with the hero’s tactics.
Antagonists and heroes in conflict are like horses in a team pulling in
different directions, while villains and heroes in conflict are like trains
on a head-on collision course.
iD
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION
The Shadow can represent the power of repressed feelings. Deep
trauma or guilt can fester when exiled to the darkness of the unconscious, and emotions hidden or denied can turn into something
monstrous that wants to destroy us. If the Threshold Guardian represents neuroses, then the Shadow archetype stands for psychoses that
not only hamper us, but threaten to destroy us. The Shadow may simply be that shady part of ourselves that we are always wrestling with in
struggles over bad habits and old fears. This energy can be a powerful
internal force with a life of its own and its own set of interests and priorities. It can be a destructive force, especially if not acknowledged,
confronted, and brought to light.
Thus in dreams, Shadows may appear as monsters, demons,
devils, evil aliens, vampires, or other fearsome enemies. Note that
many Shadow figures are also shapeshifters, such as vampires and
werewolves.
DRAMATIC FUNCTION
The function of the Shadow in drama is to challenge the hero and
give her a worthy opponent in the struggle. Shadows create conflict
and bring out the best in a hero by putting her in a life-threatening
situation. It’s often been said that a story is only as good as its villain,
because a strong enemy forces a hero to rise to the challenge.
The challenging energy of the Shadow archetype can be expressed
in a single character, but it may also be a mask worn at different times
by any of the characters. Heroes themselves can manifest a Shadow
side. When the protagonist is crippled by doubts or guilt, acts in selfdestructive ways, expresses a death wish, gets carried away with his
success, abuses his power, or becomes selfish rather than self-sacrificing, the Shadow has overtaken him.
76
SHADOW
MASK OF THE SHADOW
The Shadow can combine in powerful ways with other archetypes.
Like the other archetypes, the Shadow is a function or mask which
can be worn by any character. The primary Mentor of a story may wear
the Shadow mask at times. In An Officer and a Gentleman, the drill
sergeant played by Louis Gossett, Jr. wears the masks of both Mentor
and Shadow. He is Richard Gere’s Mentor and second father, guiding
him through the rigorous Navy training. But in terms of the life-anddeath heart of the story, Gossett is also a Shadow who is trying to
destroy Gere by driving him out of the program. He tests the young
man to the limit to find out if he has what it takes, and almost kills
him in the process of bringing out the best in him.
Another strong combination of archetypes is found in the fatal
Shapeshifter figures discussed earlier. In some stories, the person who
starts out as the hero’s love interest shifts shape so far that she becomes
the Shadow, bent on the hero’s destruction. Femmes fatales are often
called “shady ladies.” This might represent a struggle between a person's male and female sides, or obsession with the opposite sex turned
into a psychotic state of mind. Orson Welles created a classic story on
this theme in The Lady from Shanghai, in which Rita Hayworth dazzles Welles’s character, shifts shape, and tries to destroy him.
A Shadow may also wear the masks of other archetypes. Anthony
Hopkins’s “Hannibal the Cannibal” character from The Silence of the
Lambs is primarily a Shadow, a projection of the dark side of human
nature, but he also functions as a helpful Mentor to Jodie Foster’s FBI
agent, providing her with information that helps her catch another
insane killer.
Shadows may become seductive Shapeshifters to lure the hero
into danger. They may function as Tricksters or Heralds, and may even
manifest heroic qualities. Villains who fight bravely for their cause
or experience a change of heart may even be redeemed and become
heroes themselves, like the Beast in Beauty and the Beast.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
HUMANIZING THE SHADOW
Shadows need not be totally evil or wicked. In fact, it’s better if they
are humanized by a touch of goodness, or by some admirable quality.
The Disney animated cartoons are memorable for their villains, such
as Captain Hook in Peter Pan, the demon in Fantasia, the beautiful
but wicked queen from Sxow White, the glamorous fairy Maleficent
in The Sleeping Beauty, and Cruella de Vil in One Hundred and One
Dalmatians. They are even more deliciously sinister because of their
dashing, powerful, beautiful, or elegant qualities.
Shadows can also be humanized by making them vulnerable.
The novelist Graham Greene masterfully makes his villains real, frail
people. He often has the hero on the verge of killing a villain, only to
discover the poor fellow has a head cold or is reading a letter from
his little daughter. Suddenly the villain is not just a fly to be swatted
but a real human being with weaknesses and emotions. Killing such
a figure becomes a true moral choice rather than a thoughtless reflex.
It’s important to remember in designing stories that most Shadow
figures do not think of themselves as villains or enemies. From his
point of view, a villain is the hero of his own myth, and the audience’s
hero is his villain. A dangerous type of villain is “the right man,’ the
person so convinced his cause is just that he will stop at nothing to
achieve it. Beware the man who believes the end justifies the means.
Hitler’s sincere belief that he was right, even heroic, allowed him to
order the most villainous atrocities to achieve his aims.
A Shadow may be a character or force external to the hero, or it
may be a deeply repressed part of the hero. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
vividly depicts the power of the dark side in a good man’s personality.
External Shadows must be vanquished or destroyed by the hero.
Shadows of the internal kind may be disempowered like vampires,
simply by bringing them out of the Shadows and into the light of
consciousness. Some Shadows may even be redeemed and turned into
positive forces. One of the most impressive Shadow figures in movie
78
SHADOW
history, Darth Vader of the Star Wars series, is revealed in Return of
the Jedi to be the hero’s father. All his wickedness is finally forgiven,
making him a benign, ghostly figure, watching over his son. The Terminator also grows from being a killing machine bent on destroying
the heroes in The Terminator to being a protective Mentor to the
heroes in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.
Like the other archetypes, Shadows can express positive as well
as negative aspects. The Shadow in a person’s psyche may be anything
that has been suppressed, neglected, or forgotten. The Shadow shelters the healthy, natural feelings we believe we’re not supposed to
show. But healthy anger or grief, if suppressed in the territory of the
Shadow, can turn to harmful energy that strikes out and undermines
us in unexpected ways. The Shadow may also be unexplored potential,
such as affection, creativity, or psychic ability, that goes unexpressed.
“The roads not taken,’ the possibilities of life that we eliminate by
making choices at various stages, may collect in the Shadow, biding
their time until brought into the light of consciousness.
ge
The psychological concept of the Shadow archetype is a useful metaphor for understanding villains and antagonists in our stories, as well
as for grasping the unexpressed, ignored, or deeply hidden aspects of
our heroes.

“From quiet homes and first beginning
Out to the undiscovered ends
There's nothing worth the wear of winning
But laughter and the love of friends.”
— From “Dedicatory Ode” by Hilaire Belloc
eroes on their journeys may need someone to
travel with them, an Ally who can serve a variety of necessary functions, such as companion,
sparring partner, conscience, or comic relief. It’s
useful to have someone to send on errands, to carry messages, to scout
locations. It’s convenient to have someone for the hero to talk to, to
bring out human feelings or reveal important questions in the plot.
Allies do many mundane tasks but also serve the important function
of humanizing the heroes, adding extra dimensions to their personalities, or challenging them to be more open and balanced.
From the dawn of storytelling, heroes have been paired with
friendly figures who fight at their sides, advise, and warn them,
and sometimes challenge them. In one of the first great stories ever
recorded, the tale of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian hero-king is linked
by the gods with a mighty wild man of the forest, Enkidu, who at first
mistrusts and opposes him, but soon wins his respect and becomes
81
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
his trusted Ally. Hercules had a valuable ally in his charioteer Iolaus,
an Olympic champion who cauterized the necks of the Hydra to
keep the heads from growing back after Hercules knocked them off
with his club.
MULTIPLE ALLIES
Heroes on great epic journeys may acquire whole ship-loads of Allies,
building up a team of adventurers, each with his or her different skill.
Odysseus has his shipmates and Jason has his Argonauts. In the British
Isles, King Arthur, beginning with his foster-brother Sir Kay, attracts a
small army of Allies, the Knights of the Round Table. In France, Charlemagne gathers a similar band of Ally knights from all the nations of
his empire who become known as his Paladins. Dorothy picks up a
series of Allies on her quest, starting with her animal Ally Toto.
GREAT ALLIES IN LITERATURE
Some great stories have been woven from the relationship between
a hero and an Ally. Don Quixote and his reluctant squire Sancho
Panza form one such pair, representing two extremes of society and
very different ways of viewing the world. Shakespeare often employs
Allies like Lear’s Fool or Prince Hal’s riotous companion Falstaff to
explore his heroes more deeply, providing the heroes with comic foils
or challenging them to look more deeply into their own souls. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson are another example, where the
amazing intellect of Holmes is unfolded for the reader through the
admiring eyes of his Ally, Watson, narrator of the tales.
INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL WORLD
Dr. Watson illustrates a useful function for Allies of introducing us
to an unfamiliar world. Like Watson, they can ask the questions we
would be asking. When the hero is tight-lipped or where it would
be awkward and unrealistic for him or her to explain things that are
82
ALLY
second nature to the hero but very exotic to us, an Ally can do the
work of explaining everything as needed. The Ally is sometimes an
“audience character,’ someone who sees the Special World of the story
with fresh eyes as we would do if we were there.
Novelist Patrick O'Brian employed this device in his epic Master
and Commander series about the British Navy in the Napoleonic Wars.
His hero, Jack Aubrey, is similar to heroes of other seafaring books like
C. S. Forester’s Horatio Hornblower, but O’Brian’s books are distinguished by the introduction of a strong, life-long Ally for the dashing
sea captain, in the character of Stephen Maturin, a doctor, naturalist,
and secret agent who remains a stranger to the ways of the sea despite
decades of sailing with his friend. O’Brian provides much comedy with
Stephen’s clumsy attempts to understand the jargon of the sailor, but
also gives a good reason for the exasperated Jack to explain details of
battle and sailing that we, the readers, want to know about.
WESTERN ALLIES: SIDEKICKS
In the rich tradition of Hollywood Western movie serials and TV
shows, the Ally is called a “sidekick,” a term from early nineteenthcentury pickpocket’s slang for a side pants pocket. In other words,
a sidekick is someone you keep as close to you as your side pocket.
Every TV Western hero had to have his Ally, from the Lone Ranger’s
“faithful Indian companion” Tonto to Wild Bill Hickok’s “comical
sidekick” Jingles, played by character actor Andy Devine, who also
filled the Ally’s role in many Western movies going back to Stagecoach.
The Cisco Kid had his comic foil Pancho; Zorro had his silent but
very useful accomplice Bernardo. Walter Brennan played a gallery of
sidekicks, notably supporting John Wayne in Red River. There he goes
beyond the usual roles of Ally as provider of comic relief and someone for the hero to talk to. He also serves as a conscience, muttering
every time John Wayne’s character makes a moral error and rejoicing
when Wayne’s surrogate son finally stands up to him.
83
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The relationship with the Ally can be quite complex, sometimes
becoming dramatic material in its own right. A vast body of story
has been written and filmed about self-righteous Western lawman
Wyatt Earp and his unruly, alcoholic, sickly, but very dangerous Ally,
Doc Holliday. In some versions of the tale, like director John Sturges’s thundering Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the two men are nearly
equally matched, and while joining together to fight the external
threat of the Clanton gang, they are also two horns of a great debate
in American culture, between the rigid moral universe of the Puritans,
represented by law-abiding Wyatt Earp, and the wilder rebel side represented by Holliday, a gambler from the old South.
NON-HUMAN ALLIES
Allies need not be human. In some religions of the world, each person
is assigned a spirit protector, a lifelong sidekick or Ally. This may be an
angel, the guardian angel who is supposed to look out for the person
and keep them on the right path, or a minor deity of some kind. The
Egyptians taught that Khnemu, the ram-headed builder god, fashioned each person out of clay on his potter’s wheel and at the same
time made a “ka” or spirit protector in the exact same shape. The ka
accompanied each person throughout life and on into the afterlife as
long as the person’s body was preserved. Its job was to encourage the
person to lead a good and useful life.
The Romans also believed that every man had a guardian spirit
or Ally, his “genius,” and that every woman had a “juno.” Originally
these were ghosts of the family’s distinguished ancestors, but later
came to be personal guardian deities. Each person made offerings to
the genius or juno on his or her birthday, in return for guidance and
protection or a little extra brain power. Not only individuals but also
families, households, the Senate, cities, provinces, and entire empires
could have such protective supernatural Allies.
84
PND OD ONE
The play and movie Harvey show a man who relies on an imaginary friend, a kind of psychic Ally who helps him cope with reality.
Woody Allen’s character in Play It Again, Sam conjures up the spirit of
Humphrey Bogart’s movie persona to guide him through the subtleties of love. It’s a Wonderful Life depicts a desperate man being helped
by an angel Ally.
ANIMAL ALLIES
Animals as Allies are common in the history of storytelling. Goddesses especially are accompanied by animal Allies, like Athena and
her companion owl, or Artemis and the deer who is often seen running at her side. The jester of European folktale, Till Eulenspiegel, was
always associated with two symbols, an owl and a mirror. His name
“Eulenspiegel” means “Owl-Mirror” and suggests that he is wise as
an owl and that he holds up a mirror to the hypocrisy of society. The
owl became Till’s reluctant Ally in the animated film Til/ Eulenspiegel. The heroes of Westerns are often supported by animal Allies like
Roy Rogers's elegant steed Trigger and dog Bullet.
ALLIES FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
Ancient folktales tell of Allies even among the dead. The name for the
band “The Grateful Dead” had its origins in a folktale term for the
dead who give aid to living people in gratitude for doing something to
set their souls at rest, such as paying a debt to give them decent burial.
The Helpful Ghost is the title of a romance novel by Sheila Rosalind
Allen in which a ghost sorts out romantic matters in an old house.
HELPFUL SERVANTS
Another folktale Ally motif is the “helpful servant,’ a stock character in tales of romance who helps the hero achieve his or her goal by
carrying love letters and messages or providing disguises, hideaways,
escape routes, and alibis. D’Artagnan’s long-suffering valet Planchet
85
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
is one of the helpful servants in The Three Musketeers and Dudley
Moore’s butler, played by stately John Gielgud, performs the role in
Arthur. Batman’s butler Alfred serves many roles and it should be
noted that the Ally function can easily overlap with that of the Mentor, as Allies occasionally step up to the higher function of guiding
the hero in spiritual or emotional matters.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION
The Ally in dreams and fiction might represent the unexpressed or
unused parts of the personality that must be brought into action to
do their jobs. In stories, Allies remind us of these under-utilized parts
and bring to mind actual friends or relationships that may be helpful
to us in the journey of our lives. Allies may represent powerful internal forces that can come to our aid in a spiritual crisis.
MODERN ALLIES
Allies thrive in the modern world of storytelling. Allies in fiction suggest alternate paths for problem-solving and help to round out the
personalities of heroes, allowing expression of fear, humor, or ignorance that might not be appropriate for the hero. James Bond relies
on his loyal Ally Miss Moneypenny and occasionally needs the help of
his American Ally, CIA man Felix Leiter. Comic book writers, aiming
to expand the appeal of their stories to younger readers, will often add
young Allies for their superheroes, like Batman’s ward Robin. Simba,
the young lion hero of The Lion King, has his comical Allies Timon
and Pumbaa. One vision of the future is provided by the Star Wars
universe where machines, animals, alien beings, and spirits of the dead
all can serve as Allies. Increasingly, computer intelligences and robots
will be seen as natural Allies as we move on to new journeys into space
and other uncharted realms.

“That makes no sense and so do I”
— Daffy Duck
he Trickster archetype embodies the energies
of mischief and desire for change. All the characters in stories who are primarily clowns or
comical sidekicks express this archetype. The
specialized form called the Trickster Hero is
the leading figure in many myths and is very popular in folklore and
fairy tales.
PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION
Tricksters serve several important psychological functions. They
cut big egos down to size, and bring heroes and audiences down to
earth. By provoking healthy laughter they help us realize our common
bonds, and they point out folly and hypocrisy. Above all, they bring
about healthy change and transformation, often by drawing attention
to the imbalance or absurdity of a stagnant psychological situation.
They are the natural enemies of the status quo. Trickster energy can
express itself through impish accidents or slips of the tongue that
alert us to the need for change. When we are taking ourselves too
89
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY

seriously, the Trickster part of our personalities may pop up to bring
back needed perspective.
DRAMATIC FUNCTION: COMIC RELIEF
In drama, Tricksters serve all these psychological functions, plus the
dramatic function of comic relief. Unrelieved tension, suspense, and
conflict can be emotionally exhausting, and in even the heaviest drama
an audience’s interest is revived by moments of laughter. An old rule
of drama points out the need for balance: Make ’em cry a lot; let em
laugh a little.
Tricksters may be servants or Allies working for the hero
or Shadow, or they may be independent agents with their own.
skewed agendas.
The Tricksters of mythology provide many examples of the workings of this archetype. One of the most colorful is Loki, the Norse
god of trickery and deceit. A true Trickster, he serves the other gods
as legal counselor and advisor, but also plots their destruction, undermining the status quo. He is fiery in nature, and his darting, elusive
energy helps heat up the petrified, frozen energy of the gods, moving
them to action and change. He also provides much-needed comic
relief in the generally dark Norse myths.
Loki is sometimes a comical sidekick character in stories featuring
the gods Odin or Thor as heroes. In other stories he is a hero of sorts,
a Trickster Hero who survives by his wits against physically stronger
gods or giants. At last he turns into a deadly adversary or Shadow,
leading the hosts of the dead in a final war against the gods.
TRICKSTER HEROES
Trickster Heroes have bred like rabbits in the folktales and fairy tales
of the world. Indeed, some of the most popular Tricksters are rabbit
heroes: the Br’er Rabbit of the American South, the Hare of African
tales, the many rabbit heroes from Southeast Asia, Persia, India, etc.
90
TRICKSTER
These stories pit the defenseless but quick-thinking rabbit against
much larger and more dangerous enemies: folktale Shadow figures
like wolves, hunters, tigers, and bears. Somehow the tiny rabbit always
manages to outwit his hungry opponent, who usually suffers painfully
from dealing with a Trickster Hero.
The modern version of the rabbit Trickster is of course Bugs
Bunny. The Warner Brothers animators made use of folktale plots
to pit Bugs against hunters and predators who didn’t stand a chance
against his quick wits. Other cartoon Tricksters of this type include
Warner's Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, the Roadrunner, and Tweety
Bird; Walter Lantz’s Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy the penguin; and MGM's ubiquitous dog Droopy, who always outwits the
~ befuddled Wolf. Mickey Mouse started as an ideal animal Trickster,
although he has matured into a sober master of ceremonies and corporate spokesman.
Native Americans have a particular fondness for Tricksters such
as Coyote and Raven. The clown Kachina gods of the Southwest are
Tricksters of great power as well as comic ability.
Once in a while it’s fun to turn the tables and show that Tricksters themselves can be outwitted. Sometimes a Trickster like the Hare
will try to take advantage of a weaker, slower animal like Mr. Tortoise.
In folktales and fables such as “The Tortoise and the Hare,” the slowest outwits the fastest by dogged persistence or by cooperating with
others of its kind to outwit the faster animal.
Tricksters like to stir up trouble for its own sake. Joseph Campbell relates a Nigerian story in which the Trickster god Edshu walks
down a road in a hat that’s red on one side and blue on the other.
When people comment, “Who was that going by in a red hat?” they
get into fights with people on the other side of the road who insist the
hat was blue. The god takes credit for the trouble, saying, “Spreading
strife is my greatest joy.”

Tricksters are often catalyst characters, who affect the lives of
others but are unchanged themselves. Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills
Cop displays Trickster energy as he stirs up the existing system without changing much himself.
The heroes of comedy, from Charlie Chaplin to the Marx Brothers to the cast of In Living Color, are Tricksters who subvert the status
quo and make us laugh at ourselves. Heroes of other genres must often
put on the Trickster mask in order to outwit a Shadow or get around
a Threshold Guardian.

The archetypes are an infinitely flexible language of character. They
offer a way to understand what function a character is performing at
a given moment in a story. Awareness of the archetypes can help to
free writers from stereotyping, by giving their characters greater psychological verity and depth.
The archetypes can be used to make characters who are both
unique individuals and universal symbols of the qualities that form a
complete human being. They can help make our characters and stories psychologically realistic and true to the ancient wisdom of myths.
92
BEYOND ARGHE TRE
While the archetypes can take you a long way towards understanding
the jobs characters do in stories, there is of course a good deal more to
creating characters who are believable and compelling to watch. Following are some of the other things that go into making well-rounded,
realistic characters.
CHARACTER ESSENTIALS
When you create a character, use the following checklist to see if you
are considering all the possible angles that will make that character
real and memorable.
MOTIVATED. We have to know what they want, what they wish
for, what drives them. On a deeper level, what do they need to complete or heal them?
SYMPATHETIC. We should feel sorry for them, or appreciate something about their attitude or behavior.
WOUNDED. They bear the scars of old injuries, or there is a shadow
hanging over them of guilt or suspicion.
CHARACTER FLAWS. They have some bad qualities or weaknesses, some areas where they fail or make mistakes. This makes them
believable and human.
IDENTIFICATION. These small mistakes, together with the strong
desires that motivate characters, help us to IDENTIFY with them.
We all make mistakes and we feel sympathy for the heroes who fail.
We feel they are like us, and what they feel, we feel.
CHARACTER VIRTUES. They have some special good qualities
that are attractive or funny.
UNIQUE. Each character has a unique combination of qualities. No
two are exactly alike.
94
BEYOND ARCHETYPES
CHARACTER CHANGE. The story creates pressure for the character to change behavior. The audience enjoys seeing this pressure
and they like to see the moment when the character begins to change.
CHARACTER ARC. In a realistic story, characters change little by
little. They probably remain true to their basic natures, but change a
little in how they think or behave.
INNER AND OUTER PROBLEM. Every character should have an
outer problem to solve, something physical or external. They should
also have an inner problem, such as becoming a better team player,
forgiving someone, learning to be more responsible, breaking a bad
habit, etc.
IN TV COMEDIES. Characters don’t change very much. If they do,
it is for a short time and they usually return to their old behavior at
the end of the show.
BIG REVERSAL. The audience enjoys seeing a TOUGH CHARACTER show a more sensitive side. They also like to seea WEAK or
FEARFUL CHARACTER show a strong side of courage.
INTRODUCTION OF CHARACTERS. Give them a strong
entrance. Tell the audience who the characters are by showing them
doing something that expresses their basic nature.
CHOICES. The choices a character makes define the character. We
know who they really are by the choices they make. (Think of Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, revealing her true nature by
destroying the innocent populace of King’s Landing.)
HOW etOuREV EAL CHARACTERS Through ACTION,
DIALOGUE, COSTUME, PROPS, BODY LANGUAGE, SURROUNDINGS, WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THEM, but
mostly through BEHAVIOR. How do they react in tense or embarrassing situations? How do they treat other people?
CATHARSIS. The audience enjoys seeing characters who are
driven to extremes of behavior. Sometimes they have an emotional
95
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
breakdown or breakthrough — crying, screaming, getting very excited
about something. This kind of breakthrough is called a catharsis. The
audience can experience it too, through sympathy with the characters.
SOME CHARACTER QUESTIONS
Your characters have to be real to you before they can be real to the
audience. Get to know them by conducting thought experiments,
such as interviewing your characters in your imagination. You can
even ask characters to describe each other. It can be very revealing to
‘ask what they think of their fellow characters.
What does my character want? What does he or she really need?
What makes the character laugh? Cry?
What is the character’s greatest fear?
What is the one thing he/she will not do?
When your character wishes upon a star, what does he/she wish for?
When your character dreams, what are the dreams about?
What is your character’s deepest wound so far? *
What is the character’s morning routine? Late sleeper, early riser?
Does he/she have any rituals before going to bed?
Does the character cling to any superstitions?
Who does your character admire the most? Who does he/she hate
the most? Who can your he/she trust? What do the other characters
think or assume about him/her?
What is his/her best quality? Worst quality? What are some other
qualities that might be surprising or charming? You need at least three
to make a character seem realistic and three-dimensional.
What is his/her secret wish?
What is he/she hiding?
What is his/her “agon” — the one thing he/she will always have to
struggle with?

STAGE ONE:
THE ORDINARY WORLD
ee
‘A beginning is a very delicate time.”
— from Dune, screenplay by David Lynch,
based on the novel by Frank Herbert
n The Hero With a Thousand Faces, Joseph
Campbell describes the beginning of the typical hero’s journey. “A hero ventures forth from
the world of common day into a region of
supernatural wonder ...” In this chapter, we'll
explore that “world of common day,’ the Ordinary World, and see
how it frames the hero and sets modern-day stories in motion.
The opening of any story, be it myth, fairy tale, screenplay, novel,
short story, or comic book, has some special burdens to bear. It must
hook the reader or viewer, set the tone of the story, suggest where it’s
going, and get across a mass of information without slowing the pace.
A beginning is, indeed, a delicate time.
BEFORE THE BEGINNING
Before a story even begins, a storyteller faces creative choices. What's
the first thing your audience will experience? The title? The first line
99
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of dialogue? The first image? Where in the lives of your characters
will the story actually begin? Do you need a prologue or introduction,
or should you jump right into the middle of the action? The opening moments are a powerful opportunity to set the tone and create
an impression. You can conjure up a mood, an image, or a metaphor
that will give the audience a frame of reference to better experience
your work. The mythological approach to story boils down to using
metaphors or comparisons to get across your feelings about life.
The great German stage and film director Max Reinhardt believed
that you can create an atmosphere in a theatre well before an audience
sits down or the curtain goes up. A carefully selected title can strike a
metaphor that intrigues the audience and attunes them to the coming
experience. Good promotion can engage them with images and slogans
that are metaphors for the world of your story. By controlling music
and lighting as the audience enters the space, and consciously directing
such details as the attitudes and costumes of the ushers, a specific mood
can be created. The audience can be put in the ideal frame of mind for
the experience they will share, prepared for comedy, romance, horror,
drama, or whatever effect you wish to create.
Oral storytellers begin their tales with ritualized phrases (“Once
upon a time”) and personalized gestures to get the attention of the
audience. These signals can cue the listeners to the funny, sad, or ironic
mood of the story they will hear.
Today many elements go into making those first impressions
before the book or the movie ticket is bought; the title, the book
cover art, publicity and advertising, posters and trailers, and so forth.
The story is cooked down to a few symbols or metaphors that begin
to put the audience in the right mood for the journey.
TITLE
A title is an important clue to the nature of the story and the writer’s
attitude. A good title can become a multileveled metaphor for the
100
THE ORDINARY WORLD
condition of the hero or his world. The title of The Godfather, for
example, suggests that Don Corleone is both god and father to his
people. The graphic design of the logo for the novel and movie lays
out another metaphor, the hand of a puppeteer working the strings
of an unseen marionette. Is Don Corleone the puppeteer, or is he the
puppet of a higher force? Are we all puppets of God, or do we have
free will? The metaphoric title and imagery allow many interpretations and help to make the story a coherent design.
OPENING IMAGE
The opening image can be a powerful tool to create mood and suggest
where the story will go. It can be a visual metaphor that, in a single
shot or scene, conjures up the Special World of Act Two and the conflicts and dualities that will be confronted there. It can suggest the
theme, alerting the audience to the issues your characters will face. The
opening shot of Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven shows a man outside a
farmhouse, digging a grave for his wife who has just died. His relationship with his wife and the way she changed him are major themes in
the story. The image of a man digging a grave outside his house can be
read as an apt metaphor for the plot: The hero leaves home and journeys to the land of death, where he witnesses death, causes death, and
almost dies himself. Eastwood the director returns to the same setup
at the end of the film, using the image to give a sense of closure as we
see the man leave the grave and return to his home.
PROLOGUE
Some stories begin with a prologue section that precedes the main
body of the story, perhaps before the introduction of the main characters and their world. The fairy tale of “Rapunzel” begins with a scene
before the birth of the hero, and Disney’s Beauty and the Beast begins
with a prologue illustrated in stained glass, giving the backstory of the
Beast’s enchantment. Myths take place within a context of mythical
101
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
history that goes back to the Creation, and events leading up to the
entrance of the main character may have to be portrayed first. Shakespeare and the Greeks often gave their plays a prologue, spoken by a
narrator or a chorus, to set the tone and give the context of the drama.
Shakespeare’s Henry V begins with an eloquent passage, intoned by a
Chorus character who invites us to use our “imaginary forces” to create the kings, horses, and armies of his story. “Admit me Chorus to
this history,” he requests, “Who, prologue-like, your humble patience
pray/Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.”
A prologue can serve several useful functions. It may give an essential piece of backstory, cue the audience to what kind of movie or story
this is going to be, or start the story with a bang and let the audience
settle into their seats. In Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a prologue
shows the discovery of a mysterious squadron of World War II airplanes,
perfectly preserved in the desert. This precedes the introduction of the
hero, Roy Neary, and his world. It serves to intrigue the audience with
a host of riddles, and gives a foretaste of the thrills and wonder ahead.
In The Last Boy Scout a prologue shows a pro football player
going berserk and shooting his teammates under the pressure of drugs
and gambling. The sequence precedes the first appearance of the hero
and intrigues or “hooks” the audience. It signals that this is going to
be an exciting action story involving life-and-death matters.
This prologue and the one in Close Encounters are a little disorienting. They hint that these movies are going to be about
extraordinary events that may strain credibility. In secret societies,
an old rule of initiation is: Disorientation leads to suggestibility.
That’s why initiates are often blindfolded and led around in the dark,
so they will be more psychologically open to suggestion from the rituals staged by the group. In storytelling, getting the audience a little
off-base and upsetting their normal perceptions can put them into a
receptive mood. They begin to suspend their disbelief and enter more
readily into a Special World of fantasy.
102
THE ORDINARY WORLD
Some prologues introduce the villain or threat of the story
before the hero appears. In Star Wars, the evil Darth Vader is shown
kidnapping Princess Leia before the hero, Luke Skywalker, is introduced in his mundane world. Some detective films begin with a
murder before the hero is introduced in his office. Such prologues
cue the audience that the balance of a society has been disturbed.
A chain of events is set in motion, and the forward drive of the
story cannot cease until the wrong has been righted and the balance restored.
A prologue is not necessary or desirable in every case. The needs
of the story will always dictate the best approach to structure. You
may want to begin, as many stories do, by introducing the hero in her
normal environment: the “Ordinary World.”
THE ORDINARY WORLD
Because so many stories are journeys that take heroes and audiences
to Special Worlds, most begin by establishing an Ordinary World as
a baseline for comparison. The Special World of the story is only special if we can see it in contrast to a mundane world of everyday affairs
from which the hero issues forth. The Ordinary World is the context,
home base, and background of the hero.
The Ordinary World in one sense is the place you came from last.
In life we pass through a succession of Special Worlds which slowly
become ordinary as we get used to them. They evolve from strange,
foreign territory to familiar bases from which to launch a drive into
the next Special World.
CONTRAST
It’s a good idea for writers to make the Ordinary World as different
as possible from the Special World, so audience and hero will experience a dramatic change when the threshold is finally crossed. In The
Wizard of Oz the Ordinary World is depicted in black and white,
103
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
to make a stunning contrast with the Technicolor Special World of
Oz. In the thriller Dead Again, the Ordinary World of modern day is
shot in color to contrast with the nightmarish black-and-white Special World of the 1940s flashbacks. City Slickers contrasts the drab,
restrictive environment of the city with the more lively arena of the
West where most of the story takes place.
Compared to the Special World, the Ordinary World may seem
boring and calm, but the seeds of excitement and challenge can usually
be found there. The hero’s problems and conflicts are already present
in the Ordinary World, waiting to be activated.
FORESHADOWING:
A MODEL OF THE SPECIAL WORLD
Writers often use the Ordinary World section to create a small model
of the Special World, foreshadowing its battles and moral dilemmas.
In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy clashes with ornery Miss Gulch and is
rescued from danger by three farmhands. These early scenes foretell
Dorothy’s battles with the Witch and her rescue by the Tin Woodsman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow.
Romancing the Stone begins with a clever foreshadowing technique. The first thing the audience sees is an elaborate fantasy of
a noble heroine battling sleazy villains and finally riding off to
romance with a comically idealized hero. The scene is a model of
the Special World Joan Wilder will encounter in the second act. The
fantasy is revealed to be the conclusion of Joan Wilder’s romance
novel, which she is writing in her cluttered New York apartment.
The opening fantasy sequence serves a dual purpose. It tells us a great
deal about Joan Wilder and her unrealistic notions of romance, and
also predicts the problems and situations she will face in the Special World of Act Two, when she encounters real villains and a less
than ideal man. Foreshadowing can help unify a story into a rhythmic or poetic design.
104
THE ORDINARY WORLD
RAISING THE DRAMATIC QUESTION
Another important function of the Ordinary World is to suggest the
dramatic question of the story. Every good story poses a series of
questions about the hero. Will she achieve the goal, overcome her
flaw, learn the lesson she needs to learn? Some questions relate primarily to the action or plot. Will Dorothy get home from Oz? Will
E.T. get home to his planet? Will the hero get the gold, win the game,
beat the villains?
Other questions are dramatic and have to do with the hero’s emotions and personality. Will Patrick Swayze’s character in Ghost learn to
express love? In Pretty Woman, will the uptight businessman Edward
learn from the prostitute Vivian how to relax and enjoy life? The
action questions may propel the plot, but the dramatic questions hook
the audience and involve them with the emotions of the characters.
INNER AND OUTER PROBLEMS
Every hero needs both an inner and an outer problem. In developing
fairy tales for Disney Feature Animation, we often found that writers,
in the early drafts, would give the heroes 1 good outer problem: Can
the princess manage to break an enchantment on her father who has
been turned to stone? Can the hero get to the top of a glass mountain
and win a princess’s hand in marriage? Can Gretel rescue Hansel from
the Witch? But sometimes writers neglected to give the characters a
compelling inner problem to solve as well.
Characters without inner challenges seem flat and uninvolving,
however heroically they may act. They need an inner problem, a personality flaw or a moral dilemma to work out. They need to learn
something in the course of the story: how to get along with others,
how to trust themselves, how to see beyond outward appearances.
Audiences love to see characters learning, growing, and dealing with
the inner and outer challenges of life.
105
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
MAKING AN ENTRANCE
How the audience first experiences your hero is another important
condition you control as a storyteller. What is he doing the first time
we see him, when he makes his entrance? What is he wearing, who
is around him, and how do they react to him? What is his attitude,
emotion, and goal at that precise moment in the story? Does he enter
alone or join a group, or is he already on stage when the story begins?
Does he narrate the story, is it told through the eyes of another character, or is it seen from the objective eye of conventional narrative?
Every actor likes to “make an entrance,” an important part of
building a character’s relationship with the audience. Even if a character is written as already on stage when the lights come up, the actor
will often make an entrance out of it by how she first impresses an
audience with her appearance and behavior. As writers we can give
our heroes an entrance by thinking about how the audience first experiences them. What are they doing, saying, feeling? What is their
context when we first see them? Are they at peace or in turmoil? Are
they at full emotional power or are they holding back for a burst of
expression later?
Most important is: What is the character doing at the moment
of entrance? The character’s first action is a wonderful opportunity
to speak volumes about his attitude, emotional state, background,
strengths, and problems. The first action should be a model of the
hero's characteristic attitude and the future problems or solutions that
will result. The first behavior we see should be characteristic. It should
define and reveal character, unless your intent is to mislead the audience and conceal the character’s true nature.
Tom Sawyer makes a vivid entrance into our imaginations
because Samuel Clemens has painted such a character-revealing first
look at his Missouri boy hero. The first time we see Tom he is performing a characteristic action, turning the rotten job of whitewashing the
fence into a wonderful mind game. Tom is acon artist, but the con is
106
THE ORDINARY WORLD
thoroughly enjoyed by his victims. Tom’s character is revealed through
all his actions, but most clearly and definitively in his entrance, which
defines his attitude toward life.
Actors stepping onto a stage and writers introducing a character are also trying to entrance the audience, or produce in them a
trance-like state of identification and recognition. One of the magic
powers of writing is its ability to lure each member of the audience
into projecting a part of their ego into the character on the page,
screen, or stage.
As a writer you can build up an atmosphere of anticipation or
provide information about an important character by having other
characters talk about her before she shows up. But more important
and memorable will be her own first action upon entering the story
— her entrance.
INTRODUCING THE HERO TO THE AUDIENCE
Another important function of the Ordinary World is to introduce
the hero to the audience. Like a social introduction, the Ordinary
World establishes a bond between people and points out some common interests so that a dialogue can begin. In some way we should
recognize that the hero is like us. In a very real sense, a story invites us
to step into the hero’s shoes, to see the world through his eyes. As if
by magic we project part of our consciousness into the hero. To make
this magic work you must establish a strong bond of sympathy or common interest between the hero and the audience.
This is not to say that heroes must always be good or wholly
sympathetic. They don’t even have to be likeable, but they must be
relatable, a word used by movie executives to describe the quality of
compassion and understanding that an audience must have for a hero.
Even if the hero is underhanded or despicable, we can still understand
her plight and imagine ourselves behaving in much the same way,
given the same background, circumstances, and motivation.
107
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
IDENTIFICATION
The opening scenes should create an identification between audience
and hero, a sense that they are equals in some ways.
How do you achieve this? Create identification by giving heroes
universal goals, drives, desires, or needs. We can all relate to basic
drives such as the need for recognition, affection, acceptance, or
understanding. The screenwriter Waldo Salt, speaking of his script
for Midnight Cowboy, said that his hero Joe Buck was driven by a
universal human need to be touched. Even though Joe Buck engaged
in some pretty sleazy behavior, we sympathize with his need because
we have all experienced it at some time. Identification with universal
needs establishes a bond between audience and hero.
THE HERO’S LACK
Fairy-tale heroes have a common denominator, a quality that unites
them across boundaries of culture, geography, and time. They are
lacking something, or something is taken away from them. Often
they have just lost a family member. A mother or father has died, or a
brother or sister has been kidnapped. Fairy tales are about searching
for completeness and striving for wholeness, and often it’s a subtraction from the family unit that sets the story in motion. The need to
fill in the missing piece drives the story toward the final perfection of
“They lived happily ever after.”
Many movies begin by showing an incomplete hero or family.
Joan Wilder in Romancing the Stone and Roger Thornhill in North
by Northwest are incomplete because they need ideal mates to balance
their lives. Fay Wray’s character in King Kong is an orphan who knows
only “There's supposed to be an uncle someplace.’
These missing elements help to create sympathy for the hero, and
draw the audience into desiring her eventual wholeness. Audiences
abhor the vacuum created by a missing piece in a character.
108
THE ORDINARY WORLD
Other stories show the hero as essentially complete until a close
friend or relative is kidnapped or killed in the first act, setting in
motion a story of rescue or revenge. John Ford’s The Searchers begins
with news that a young woman has been kidnapped by Indians,
launching a classic saga of search and rescue.
Sometimes the hero's family may be complete, but something
is missing from the hero’s personality — a quality such as compassion, forgiveness, or the ability to express love. The hero of Ghost is
unable to say “I love you” at the beginning of the film. Only after he
has run the course of the journey from life to death is he able to say
those magic words.
It can be very effective to show that a hero is unable to perform
some simple task at the beginning of the story. In Ordinary People the
young hero Conrad is unable to eat French toast his mother has prepared for him. It signifies, in symbolic language, his inability to accept
being loved and cared for, because of the terrible guilt he bears over
the accidental death of his brother. It’s only after he undertakes an
emotional hero’s journey, and relives and processes the death through
therapy, that he is able to accept love. At the end of the story Conrad’s
girlfriend offers to make him breakfast, and this time he finds he has
an appetite. In symbolic language, his appetite for life has returned.
TRAGIC FLAWS
The Greek theory of tragedy, expressed twenty-four centuries ago by
Aristotle, describes a common fault of tragic heroes. They may possess many admirable qualities, but among them is one tragic flaw or
hamartia that puts them at odds with their destiny, their fellow men,
or the gods. Ultimately it leads to their destruction.
Most commonly this tragic flaw was a kind of pride or arrogance
called hubris. Tragic heroes are often superior people with extraordinary powers, but they tend to see themselves as equal to or better
than the gods. They ignore fair warnings or defy the local moral codes,
109
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
thinking they are above the laws of gods and men. This fatal arrogance
inevitably unleashes a force called Nemesis, originally a goddess of
retribution. Her job was to set things back into balance, usually by
bringing about the destruction of the tragic hero.
Every well-rounded hero has a trace of this tragic flaw, some
weakness or fault that makes him thoroughly human and real. Perfect, flawless heroes aren’t very interesting, and are hard to relate
to. Even Superman has weak spots which humanize him and make
him sympathetic: his vulnerability to Kryptonite, his inability to
see through lead, and his secret identity which is always in danger of
being exposed.
WOUNDED HEROES
Sometimes a hero may seem to be well-adjusted and in control, but
that control masks a deep psychic wound. Most of us have some old
pain or hurt that we don’t think about all the time, but which is always
vulnerable on some level of awareness. These wounds of rejection,
betrayal, or disappointment are personal echoes of a universal pain
that everyone has suffered from: the pain of the child’s physical and
emotional separation from its mother. In a larger sense, we all bear
the wound of separation from God or the womb of existence — that
place from which we are born and to which we will return when we
die. Like Adam and Eve cast out of Eden, we are forever separate from
our source, isolated and wounded.
To humanize a hero or any character, give her a wound, a visible, physical injury or a deep emotional wound. The hero of Lethal
Weapon, played by Mel Gibson, is sympathetic because he has lost a
loved one. The wound makes him edgy, suicidal, unpredictable, and
interesting. Your hero’s wounds and scars mark the areas in which he
is guarded, defensive, weak, and vulnerable. A hero may also be extrastrong in some areas as a defense for the wounded parts.

THE ORDINARY WORLD
The movie The Fisher King is a thorough study of two men and
their psychic wounds. The story is inspired by the Arthurian legend
of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King, whose physical wound symbolized a wound of the spirit. This legend tells of a king who was
wounded in the thigh and was therefore unable to rule his land or find
any pleasure in life. Under his weakened kingship, the land was dying,
and only the powerful spiritual magic of the Holy Grail could revive
it. The quest by the Knights of the Round Table to find the Grail is
the great adventure to restore health and wholeness to a system that
has been almost fatally wounded. The Jungian psychologist Robert
A. Johnson brings insight to the meaning of the Fisher King wound
in his book on masculine psychology, He.
Another wounded, almost tragic hero is Tom Dunson, played by
John Wayne in the classic Western Red River. Dunson makes a terrible moral error early in his career as a cattleman, by choosing to value
his mission more than his love, and following his head rather than
his heart. This choice leads to the death of his lover, and for the rest
of the story he bears the psychic scars of that wound. His suppressed
guilt makes him more and more harsh, autocratic, and judgmental,
The Hero Refuses a Call of the heart with tragic consequences.

and almost brings him and his adopted son to destruction before the
wound is healed by letting love back into his life.
A hero’s wounds may not be visible. People put a great deal of
energy into protecting and hiding these weak and vulnerable spots.
But in a fully developed character they will be apparent in the areas
where she is touchy, defensive, or a little too confident. The wound
may never be openly expressed to the audience — it can be a secret
between the writer and the character. But it will help give the hero a
sense of personal history and realism, for we all bear some scars from
past humiliations, rejections, disappointments, abandonments, and
failures. Many stories are about the journey to heal a wound and to
restore a missing piece to a broken psyche.
ESTABLISHING WHAT’S AT STAKE
For readers and viewers to be involved in the adventure, to care about
the hero, they have to know at an early stage exactly what’s at stake.
In other words, what does the hero stand to gain or lose in the adventure? What will be the consequences for the hero, society, and the
world if the hero succeeds or fails?
Myths and fairy tales are good models for establishing what's at
stake. They often set up a threatening condition that makes the stakes
of the game very clear. Perhaps the hero must pass a series of tests or his
head will be cut off. The Greek hero Perseus, portrayed in the movie
Clash of the Titans, must undergo many ordeals or his beloved princess
Andromeda will be devoured by a sea monster. Other tales put family
members in jeopardy like the father who is threatened in Beauty and
the Beast. The hero Belle has a strong motivation to put herself in a dangerous position at the mercy of the Beast. Her father will languish and
die unless she does the Beast’s bidding. The stakes are high and clear.
Scripts often fail because the stakes simply aren’t high enough. A
story in which the hero will only be slightly embarrassed or inconvenienced if he fails is likely to get the “So what?” reaction from readers.
112
THE ORDINARY WORLD
Make sure the stakes are high — life and death, big money, or the
hero’s very soul.
BACKSTORY AND EXPOSITION
The Ordinary World is the most appropriate place to deal with exposition and backstory. Backstory is all the relevant information about a
character’s history and background — what got her to the situation at
the beginning of the story. Exposition is the art of gracefully revealing
the backstory and any other pertinent information about the plot: the
hero’s social class, upbringing, habits, experiences, as well as the prevailing social conditions and opposing forces that may affect the hero.
Exposition is everything the audience needs to know to understand
the hero and the story. Backstory and exposition are among the hardest writing skills to master. Clumsy exposition tends to stop the story
cold. Blunt exposition draws attention to itself, giving the backstory
in the form of a voiceover or a “Harry the Explainer” character who
comes on solely for the purpose of telling the audience what the author
wants them to know. It’s usually better to put the audience right into the
action and let them figure things out as the story unfolds.
The audience will feel more involved if they have to work a little
to piece together the backstory from visual clues or exposition blurted
out while characters are emotionally upset or on the run. Backstory
can be doled out gradually over the course of the story or yielded up
grudgingly. Much is revealed by what people don’t do or say.
Many dramas are about secrets being slowly and painfully
revealed. Layer by layer the defenses protecting a hurtful secret are
torn away. This makes the audience participants in a detective story,
an emotional puzzle.
THEME
The Ordinary World is the place to state the theme of your story.
What is the story really about? If you had to boil down its essence to a
113
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
single word or phrase, what would it be? What single idea or quality is
it about? Love? Trust? Betrayal? Vanity? Prejudice? Greed? Madness?
Ambition? Friendship? What are you trying to say? Is your theme
“Love conquers all” “You can’t cheat an honest man,” “We must work
together to survive, or “Money is the root of all evil”?
Theme, a word derived from Greek, is close in meaning to the
Latin-based premise. Both words mean “something set before,” something laid out in advance that helps determine a future course. The
theme of a story is an underlying statement or assumption about an
aspect of life. Usually it’s set out somewhere in Act One, in the Ordinary World. It could be an offhand remark by one of the characters,
expressing a belief which is then rigorously tested in the course of the
story. [he real theme of the piece may not emerge or announce itself
until you have worked with the story for a while, but sooner or later
you must become aware of it. Knowing the theme is essential to making the final choices in dialogue, action, and set dressing that turn a
story into a coherent design. In a good story, everything is related
somehow to the theme, and the Ordinary World is the place to make
the first statement of the main idea.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
I refer often to The Wizard of Oz because it’s a classic movie that most
people have seen, and because it’s a fairly typical hero’s journey with
clearly delineated stages. It also has a surprising degree of psychological depth, and can be read not only asa fairy story of a little girl trying
to get back home, but also as a metaphor of a personality trying to
become complete.
As the story unfolds, the hero Dorothy has a clear outer problem.
Her dog Toto has dug up Miss Gulch’s flowerbed and Dorothy is in
trouble. She tries to elicit sympathy for her problem from her aunt
and uncle, but they are too busy preparing for a coming storm. Like
114
THE ORDINARY WORLD
the heroes of myth and legend before her, Dorothy is restless, out of
place, and doesn’t know where to light.
Dorothy also has a clear inner problem. She doesn’t ‘fit in anymore,
she doesn't feel ‘at home.” Like the incomplete heroes of fairy tales,
she has a big piece missing from her life — her parents are dead.
She doesnt yet know it, but she’s about to set out on a quest for completion: not through a marriage and the beginning of a new ideal
family, but through meeting a series of magical forces that represent
parts of a complete and perfect personality.
To foreshadow these meetings, Dorothy encounters a small model
of the Special World adventure. Bored, she tries to balance on the
thin railing of a pig pen, and falls in. Three friendly farmhands rescue her from danger, predicting the roles the same actors will play
in the Special World. The scene says, in the language of symbol,
that Dorothy has been walking a tightrope between warring sides
of her personality, and sooner or later she will need all the help she
can get, from every part of her being, to survive the inevitable fall
into conflict.
ee
Heroes may have no obvious missing piece, flaw, or wound. They may
merely be restless, uneasy, and out of sync with their environment or
culture. They may have been getting by, trying to adjust to unhealthy
conditions by using various coping mechanisms or crutches such as
emotional or chemical dependencies. They may have deluded themselves that everything is all right. But sooner or later, some new force
enters the story to make it clear they can no longer mark time. That
new energy is the Call to Adventure.

Frozen? Sully? Look at a film, play, or story of your choice. How
does the author introduce the hero? Reveal character? Give
exposition? Suggest the theme? Does the author use an image to
foreshadow or suggest where the story is going?
. In your own writing, how well do you know your hero? Do a
complete biographical sketch, specifying personal history, physical description, education, family background, job experiences,
romances, dislikes and prejudices, preferences in food, clothes,
hair, cars, etc.
. Doa timeline, specifying what the character was doing and where
he was at every stage of life. Find out what was going on in the
world at these times. What ideas, events, and people have been
the greatest influences on your character?
. How is your story’s hero incomplete? Get specific about the
character’s needs, desires, goals, wounds, fantasies, wishes, flaws,
quirks, regrets, defenses, weaknesses, and neuroses. What single
characteristic could lead to your hero’s destruction or downfall?
What single characteristic could save her? Does your character
have both an inner and an outer problem? Does she have a universal human need? How does she characteristically go about
getting that need met?
. Make a list of all the points of backstory and exposition that the
audience needs to know to get the story started. How can those
be revealed indirectly, visually, on the run, or through conflict?
. Do different cultures need different kinds of stories? Do men and
women need different kinds of stories? How are the heroic journeys of men and women different?

STAGE Two:
THE CALELTOADVENTURE
ee
‘It’s money and adventure and fame! It’s the
thrill of a lifetime!... and a long sea voyage
that starts at six oclock tomorrow!”
— from King Kong, screenplay by
James Creelman and Ruth Rose
he Ordinary World of most heroes is a static
but unstable condition. The seeds of change
and growth are planted, and it takes only a little
new energy to germinate them. That new energy,
symbolized in countless ways in myths and fairy
tales, is what Joseph Campbell termed the Call to Adventure.
GET THE STORY ROLLING
Various theories of screenwriting acknowledge the Call to Adventure by other names such as the inciting or initiating incident, the
catalyst, or the trigger. All agree that some event is necessary to
get a story rolling, once the work of introducing the main character is done.
119
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The Call to Adventure may come in the form of a message or
a messenger. It may be a new event like a declaration of war, or the
arrival of a telegram reporting that the outlaws have just been released
from prison and will be in town on the noon train to gun down the
sheriff. Serving a writ or warrant and issuing a summons are ways of
giving Calls in legal proceedings.
The Call may simply be a stirring within the hero, a messenger
from the unconscious, bearing news that it’s time for change. These
signals sometimes come in the form of dreams, fantasies, or visions.
Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind gets his Call in the
form of haunting images of Devil’s Tower drifting up from his subconscious. Prophetic or disturbing dreams help us prepare for a new
stage of growth by giving us metaphors that reflect the emotional and
spiritual changes to come.
The hero may just get fed up with things as they are. An uncomfortable situation builds up until that one last straw sends him on the
adventure. Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy has simply had enough of
washing dishes in a diner and feels the Call building up inside him to
hit the road of adventure. In a deeper sense, his universal human need
is driving him, but it takes that one last miserable day in the diner to
push him over the edge.
SYNCHRONICITY
A string of accidents or coincidences may be the message that calls a
hero to adventure. This is the mysterious force of synchronicity which
C. G. Jung explored in his writings. The coincidental occurrence of
words, ideas, or events can take on meaning and draw attention to
the need for action and change. Many thrillers such as Hitchcock’s
Strangers on a Train get rolling because an accident throws two people together as if by the hand of fate.
120
THE CALL TO ADVENTURE
TEMPTATION
The Call to Adventure may summon a hero with temptation, such as
the allure of an exotic travel poster or the sight of a potential lover.
It could be the glint of gold, the rumor of treasure, the siren song
of ambition. In the Arthurian legend of Percival (aka Parsifal), the
innocent young hero is summoned to adventure by the sight of five
magnificent knights in armor, riding off on some quest. Percival has
never seen such creatures, and is stirred to follow them. He is compelled to find out what they are, not realizing it is his destiny to soon
become one of them.
HERALDS OF CHANGE
The Call to Adventure is often delivered by a character in a story
who manifests the archetype of the Herald. A character performing
the function of Herald may be positive, negative, or neutral, but will
always serve to get the story rolling by presenting the hero with an
invitation or challenge to face the unknown. In some stories the Herald is also a Mentor for the hero, a wise guide who has the hero’s best
interests at heart. In others the Herald is an enemy, flinging a gauntlet of challenge in the hero’s face or tempting the hero into danger.
Initially heroes often have trouble distinguishing whether an
Enemy or an Ally lies behind the Herald’s mask. Many a hero has
mistaken a well-meaning mentor’s Call for that of an enemy, or misinterpreted the overtures of a villain as a friendly invitation to an
enjoyable adventure. In the thriller and film noir genres, writers may
deliberately obscure the reality of the Call. Shadowy figures may make
ambiguous offers, and heroes must use every skill to interpret them
correctly.
Often heroes are unaware there is anything wrong with their
Ordinary World and don’t see any need for change. They may be in
a state of denial. They have been just barely getting by, using an arsenal of crutches, addictions, and defense mechanisms. The job of the
121
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Herald is to kick away these supports, announcing that the world of
the hero is unstable and must be put back into healthy balance by
action, by taking risks, by undertaking the adventure.
RECONNAISSANCE
The Russian fairy-tale scholar Vladimir Propp identified a common
early phase in a story, called reconnaissance. A villain makes a survey of the hero’s territory, perhaps asking around the neighborhood if
there are any children living there, or seeking information about the
hero. This information-gathering can be a Call to Adventure, alerting
the audience and the hero that something is afoot and the struggle is
about to begin.
DISORIENTATION AND DISCOMFORT
The Call to Adventure can often be unsettling and disorienting to the
hero. Heralds sometimes sneak up on heroes, appearing in one guise
to gain a hero’s confidence and then shifting shape to deliver the Call.
Alfred Hitchcock provides a potent example in Notorious. Here the
hero is playgirl Ingrid Bergman, whose father has been sentenced as a
Nazi spy. The Call to Adventure comes from a Herald in the form of
Cary Grant, who plays an American agent trying to enlist her aid in
infiltrating a Nazi spy ring.
First he charms his way into her life by pretending to be a playboy
interested only in booze, fast cars, and her. But after she accidentally
discovers he’s a “copper,” he shifts to the mask of Herald to deliver a
deeply challenging Call to Adventure.
Bergman wakes up in bed, hung over from their night of partying. Grant, standing in the doorway, orders her to drink a bubbly
bromide to settle her stomach. It doesn’t taste good but he makes her
drink it anyway. It symbolizes the new energy of the adventure, which
tastes like poison compared to the addictions she’s been used to, but
which ultimately will be good medicine for her.
122
THE CALL TO ADVENTURE
In this scene Grant leans in a doorway, silhouetted like some dark
angel. From Bergman’s point of view, this Herald could be an angel
or a devil. The devilish possibility is suggested by his name, revealed
for the first time as “Devlin.” As he advances into the room to deliver
the Call to Adventure, Hitchcock follows him in a dizzying point-ofview shot that reflects the hung-over state of the hero, Bergman, as she
lies in bed. Grant seems to walk on the ceiling. In the symbolic language of film the shot expresses his change of position from playboy
to Herald, and its disorienting effect on the hero. Grant gives the Call,
a patriotic invitation to infiltrate a Nazi spy ring. As it is delivered,
Grant is seen right side up and in full light for the first time, representing the Call’s sobering effect on Bergman’s character.
As they talk, a crown-like, artificial hairpiece slides from Bergman’s head, showing that her fairy-tale existence as a deluded, addicted
princess must now come to an end. Simultaneously on the soundtrack
can be heard the distant call of a train leaving town, suggesting the
beginning of a long journey. In this sequence Hitchcock has used
every symbolic element at his command to signal that a major threshold of change is approaching. The Call to Adventure is disorienting
and distasteful to the hero, but necessary for her growth.
LACK OR NEED
A Call to Adventure may come in the form of a loss or subtraction
from the hero’s life in the Ordinary World. The adventure of the
movie Quest for Fire is set in motion when a Stone Age tribe’s last
scrap of fire, preserved ina bone fire-cage, is extinguished. Members
of the tribe begin to die of cold and hunger because of this loss. The
hero receives his Call to Adventure when one of the women puts the
fire-cage in front of him, signaling without words that the loss must
be made up by undertaking the adventure.
The Call could be the kidnapping of a loved one or the loss of
anything precious, such as health, security, or love.
123
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
NO MORE OPTIONS
In some stories, the Call to Adventure may be the hero simply running out of options. The coping mechanisms no longer work, other
people get fed up with the hero, or the hero is placed in increasingly
dire straits until the only way left is to jump into the adventure. In
Sister Act, Whoopi Goldberg’s character witnesses a mob murder
and has to go into hiding as a nun. Her options are limited — pretend to be a nun or die. Other heroes don’t even get that much
choice — they are simply “shanghaied” into adventure, conked on
the head to wake up far out at sea, committed to adventure whether
they like it or not.
WARNINGS FOR TRAGIC HEROES
Not all Calls to Adventure are positive summonses to high adventure.
They may also be dire warnings of doom for tragic heroes. In Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, a character cries out the warning, “Beware the
Ides of March.” In Moby Dick, the crew is warned by a crazy old man
that their adventure will turn into a disaster.
MORE THAN ONE CALL: CALL WAITING
Since many stories operate on more than one level, a story can have
more than one Call to Adventure. A sprawling epic such as Red River
has a need for several scenes of this type. John Wayne’s character Tom
Dunson receives a Call of the heart, when his lover urges him to stay
with her or take her with him on his quest. Dunson himself issues
another Call to physical adventure when he invites his cowboys to
join him on the first great cattle drive after the Civil War.
Romancing the Stone issues a complex Call to Adventure to its
hero Joan Wilder when she receives a phone call from her sister who
has been kidnapped by thugs in Colombia. The simple Call of physical
adventure is set up by the need to rescue the sister, but another Call
is being made on a deeper level in this scene. Joan opens an envelope
124
THE CALL TO ADVENTURE
which her sister’s husband has mailed to her and finds a map to the
treasure mine of E/ Corazon, “The Heart? suggesting that Joan is also
being called to an adventure of the heart.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
Dorothy's vague feelings of unease crystallize when Miss Gulch arrives
and spitefully takes away Toto. A conflict is set up between two sides
struggling for control of Dorothy’: soul. A repressive Shadow energy is
trying to bottle up the good-natured intuitive side. But the instinctive
Toto escapes. Dorothy follows her instincts, which are issuing her a Call
to Adventure, and runs away from home. She feels painted into a corner by a lack of sympathy from Aunt Em, her surrogate mother, who
has scolded her. She sets out to respond to the Call, under a sky churning with the clouds of change.
oe
The Call to Adventure is a process of selection. An unstable situation arises in a society and someone volunteers or is chosen to
take responsibility. Reluctant heroes have to be called repeatedly
as they try to avoid responsibility. More willing heroes answer to
inner calls and need no external urging. They have selected themselves for adventure. These gung-ho heroes are rare, and most heroes
must be prodded, cajoled, wheedled, tempted, or shanghaied into
adventure. Most heroes put up a good fight and entertain us by
their efforts to escape the Call to Adventure. These struggles are
the work of the reluctant hero or as Campbell called it, the Refusal
of the Call.

STAGE THREE:
NED Oo AmOr TIE CALL
ee
“Youre not cut out for this, Joan, and you know it.”
— from Romancing the Stone,
screenplay by Diane Thomas
he problem of the hero now becomes how to
respond to the Call to Adventure. Put yourself in
the hero’s shoes and you can see that it’s a difficult
passage. You're being asked to say yes to a great
unknown, to an adventure that will be exciting but
also dangerous and even life-threatening. It wouldn’t be a real adventure
otherwise. You stand at a threshold of fear, and an understandable reaction would be to hesitate or even refuse the Call, at least temporarily.
This halt on the road before the journey has really started serves
an important dramatic function of signaling the audience that the
adventure is risky. It’s not a frivolous undertaking but a danger-filled,
high-stakes gamble in which the hero might lose fortune or life. The
pause to weigh the consequences makes the commitment to the
adventure a real choice in which the hero, after this period of hesitation or refusal, is willing to stake her life against the possibility of
winning the goal. It also forces the hero to examine the quest carefully
and perhaps redefine its objectives.
129
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
AVOIDANCE
It’s natural for heroes to first react by trying to dodge the adventure.
Even Christ, in the Garden of Gethsemane on the eve of the Crucifixion, prayed “Let this cup pass from me.” He was simply checking
to see if there was any way of avoiding the ordeal. Is this trip really
necessary?
Even the most heroic of movie heroes will sometimes hesitate,
express reluctance, or flatly refuse the Call. Rambo, Rocky, and
innumerable John Wayne characters turn away from the offered
adventure at first. A common rationale for Refusal is past experience. Heroes claim to be veterans of past adventures which have
taught them the folly of such escapades. You won’t catch them
getting into the same kind of trouble again. The protest continues until the hero’s Refusal is overcome, either by some stronger
motivation (such as the death or kidnapping of a friend or relative)
which raises the stakes, or by the hero’s inborn taste for adventure
or sense of honor.
Detectives and lovers may refuse the Call at first, referring to
experiences which have made them sadder but wiser. There is charm
in seeing a hero’s reluctance overcome, and the stiffer the Refusal, the
more an audience enjoys seeing it worn down.
EXCUSES
Heroes most commonly Refuse the Call by stating a laundry list of
weak excuses. In a transparent attempt to delay facing their inevitable
fate, they say they would undertake the adventure, if not for a pressing
series of engagements. These are temporary roadblocks, usually overcome by the urgency of the quest.
PERSISTENT REFUSAL LEADS TO TRAGEDY
Persistent Refusal of the Call can be disastrous. In the Bible, Lot’s wife
is turned to a pillar of salt for denying God’s Call to leave her home in
130
REFUSAL OF THE CALL
Sodom and never look back. Looking backward, dwelling in the past,
and denying reality are forms of Refusal.
Continued denial of a high Calling is one of the marks of a tragic
hero. At the beginning of Red River, Tom Dunson refuses a Call to an
adventure of the heart and begins a slide into almost certain doom.
He continues to refuse Calls to open his heart, and is on the path of
a tragic hero. It’s only when he finally accepts the Call in Act Three
that he is redeemed and spared the tragic hero’s fate.
CONFLICTING CALLS
Actually Tom Dunson faces two Calls to Adventure at once. The Call
to the heart’s adventure comes from his sweetheart, but the one he
answers is the Call of his male ego, telling him to strike out alone on
a macho path. Heroes may have to choose between conflicting Calls
from different levels of adventure. The Refusal of the Call is a time to
articulate the hero’s difficult choices.
POSITIVE REFUSALS
Refusal of the Call is usually a negative moment in the hero’s progress, a dangerous moment in which the adventure might go astray or
never get off the ground at all. However, there are some special cases
in which refusing the Call is a wise and positive move on the part of
the hero. When the Call is a temptation to evil or a summons to disaster, the hero is smart to say no. The Three Little Pigs wisely refused to
open the door to the Big Bad Wolf’s powerful arguments. [x Death
Becomes Her, Bruce Willis’s character receives several powerful Calls
to drink a magic potion of immortality. Despite an alluring sales pitch
by Isabella Rossellini, he Refuses the Call and saves his own soul.
ARTIST AS HERO
Another special case in which Refusal of the Call can be positive is
that of the artist as hero. We writers, poets, painters, and musicians
131
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
face difficult, contradictory Calls. We must fully immerse ourselves
in the world to find the material for our art. But we must also at times
withdraw from the world, going alone to actually make the art. Like
many heroes of story, we receive conflicting Calls, one from the outer
world, one from our own insides, and we must choose or make compromises. To answer a higher Call to express ourselves, we artists may
have to refuse the Call of what Joseph Campbell terms “the blandishments of the world.”
When you are getting ready to undertake a great adventure, the
Ordinary World knows somehow and clings to you. It sings its sweetest, most insistent song, like the Sirens trying to draw Odysseus and
his crew onto the rocks. Countless distractions tempt you off track
as you begin to work. Odysseus had to stop up the ears of his men -
with wax so they wouldn't be lured onto the rocks by the Sirens’
bewitching song.
However, Odysseus first had his men tie him to the mast, so he
could hear the Sirens but would be unable to steer the ship into danger. Artists sometimes ride through life like Odysseus lashed to the
mast, with all senses deeply experiencing the song of life, but also
voluntarily bound to the ship of their art. They are refusing the powerful Call of the world, in order to follow the wider Call of artistic
expression.
WILLING HEROES
While many heroes express fear, reluctance, or refusal at this stage,
others don't hesitate or voice any fear. They are willing heroes who
have accepted or even sought out the Call to Adventure. Propp calls
them “seekers” as opposed to “victimized heroes.” However, the fear
and doubt represented by the Refusal of the Call will find expression
even in the stories of willing heroes. Other characters will express the
fear, warning the hero and the audience of what may happen on the
road ahead.
132
REFUSAL OF THE CALL
A willing hero like John Dunbar from Dances With Wolves may
be past the fear of personal death. He has already sought out death
in the first sequence of the movie as he rides suicidally in front of
Rebel rifles and is miraculously spared. He seeks out the adventure of the West willingly, without refusal or reluctance. But the
danger and harshness of the prairie is made clear to the audience
through the fate of other characters who represent Refusal of the
Call. One is the mad, pathetic Army officer who gives Dunbar his
scribbled “orders.” He shows a possible fate for Dunbar. The frontier
is so strange and challenging that it can drive some people insane.
The officer has been unable to accept the reality of this world, has
retreated into denial and fantasy, and refuses the frontier’s Call by
shooting himself.
The other character who bears the energy of Refusal is the
scroungy wagon driver who escorts Dunbar to his deserted post. He
expresses nothing but fear of the Indians and the prairie, and wants
Dunbar to Refuse the Call, abandon his enterprise, and return to
civilization. The driver ends up being brutally killed by the Indians, showing the audience another possible fate for Dunbar. Though
there is no Refusal by the hero himself, the danger of the adventure is
acknowledged and dramatized through another character.
THRESHOLD GUARDIANS
Heroes who overcome their fear and commit to an adventure may still
be tested by powerful figures who raise the banner of fear and doubt,
questioning the hero’s very worthiness to be in the game. They are
Threshold Guardians, blocking the heroes before the adventure has
even begun.
In Romancing the Stone, Joan Wilder accepts the Call and is
totally committed to the adventure for the sake of her sister in Colombia. However, the moment of fear, the way station of Refusal, is still
elaborately acknowledged in a scene with her agent, who wears the
133
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
fearful mask of a Threshold Guardian. A tough, cynical woman, she
forcefully underlines the dangers and tries to talk Joan out of going.
Like a witch pronouncing a curse, she declares that Joan is not up to
the task of being a hero. Joan even agrees with her, but is now motivated by the danger to her sister. She is committed to the adventure.
Though Joan herself does not Refuse the Call, the fear, doubt, and
danger have still been made clear to the audience.
Joan’s agent demonstrates how a character may switch masks to
show aspects of more than one archetype. She appears at first to be a
Mentor and friend to Joan, an ally in her profession and her dealings
with men. But this Mentor turns into a fierce Threshold Guardian,
blocking the way into the adventure with stern warnings. She’s like
an overprotective parent, not allowing the daughter to learn through
her own mistakes. Her function at this point is to test the hero’s commitment to the adventure.
This character serves another important function. She poses a
dramatic question for the audience. Is Joan truly heroic enough to face
and survive the adventure? This doubt is more interesting than knowing that the hero will rise to every occasion. Such questions create
emotional suspense for the audience, who watch the hero’s progress
with uncertainty hanging in the back of their minds. Refusal of the
Call often serves to raise such doubts.
It’s not unusual for a Mentor to change masks and perform
the function of a Threshold Guardian. Some Mentors guide the
hero deeper into the adventure; others block the hero’s path on an
adventure society might not approve of — an illicit, unwise, or dangerous path. Such a Mentor/Threshold Guardian becomes a powerful
embodiment of society or culture, warning the hero not to go outside
the accepted bounds. In Beverly Hills Cop, Eddie Murphy’s Detroit
police boss stands in his way, orders him off the case, and draws a line
which Murphy is not supposed to cross. Of course Murphy does cross
the line, immediately.
134
REFUSAL OF THE CALL
THE SECRET DOOR
Heroes inevitably violate limits set by Mentors or Threshold Guardians, due to what we might call the Law of the Secret Door. When
Belle in Beauty and the Beast is told she has the run of the Beast’s
household, except for one door which she must never enter, we know
that she will be compelled at some point to open that secret door. If
Pandora is told she must not open the box, she won't rest until she’s
had a peek inside. If Psyche is told she must never look upon her lover
Cupid, she will surely find a way to lay eyes on him. These stories are
symbols of human curiosity, the powerful drive to know all the hidden things, all the secrets.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
Dorothy runs away from home and gets as far as the carnival wagon of
Professor Marvel, a Wise Old Man whose function, in this incarnation, is
to block her at the threshold of a dangerous journey. At this point Dorothy
is a willing hero, and it’s left for the Professor to express the danger of the
road for the audience. With a bit of shamanic magic, he convinces her to
return home. He has convinced her to Refuse the Call, for now.
But in effect Professor Marvel is issuing a higher Call to go home, make
peace with her embattled feminine energy, reconnect with Aunt Em’ love,
and deal with her feelings rather than run away from them.
Although Dorothy turns back for the time being, powerful forces have been
set in motion in her life. She finds that the frightful power of the tornado,
a symbol of the feelings she has stirred up, has driven her loved ones and
allies underground, out of reach. No one can hear her. She is alone except
for Toto, her intuition. Like many a hero she finds that once started on a
journey, she can never go back to the way things were. Ultimately, Refusal
is pointless. She has already burned some bridges behind her and must
live with the consequences of taking the first step on the Road of Heroes.
Dorothy takes refuge in the empty house, the common dream symbol for
an old personality structure. But the whirling forces of change, which she
herself has stirred up, come sweeping towards her and no structure can
protect against its awesome power.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY

Caled
Refusal may be a subtle moment, perhaps just a word or two of hesitation between receiving and accepting a Call. (Often several stages
of the journey may be combined in a single scene. Folklorists call this
“conflation.”) Refusal may be a single step near the beginning of the
journey, or it may be encountered at every step of the way, depending
on the nature of the hero.
Refusal of the Call can be an opportunity to redirect the focus of
the adventure. An adventure taken on a lark or to escape some unpleasant consequence may be nudged into a deeper adventure of the spirit.
A hero hesitates at the threshold to experience the fear, to let
the audience know the formidability of the challenges ahead. But
eventually fear is overcome or set aside, often with the help of wise,
protective forces or magical gifts, representing the energy of the next
stage, Meeting with the Mentor.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. How does the hero Refuse the Call in Pretty Woman? Whiplash?
Ford v Ferrari? Rocketman? Is Refusal of the Call or reluctance a
necessary stage for every story? For every hero?
2. What are the heroes of your story afraid of ? Which are false fears
or paranoia? Which are real fears? How are they expressed?
3. In what ways have they refused Calls to Adventure, and what are
the consequences of Refusal?
4. If the protagonists are willing heroes, are there characters or forces
that make the dangers clear for the audience?
5. Have you refused Calls to Adventure, and how would your life be
different if you had accepted them?
6. Have you accepted Calls to Adventure that you wish you
had refused?

“She (Athena) assumed the appearance of Mentor and
seemed so like him as to deceive both eye and ear...”
— the Odyssey of Homer
ometimes it’s not a bad idea to refuse a Call
until you've had time to prepare for the “zone
unknown” that lies ahead. In mythology and
folklore that preparation might be done with
the help of the wise, protective figure of the
Mentor, whose many services to the hero include protecting, guiding, teaching, testing, training, and providing magical gifts. In his
study of Russian folktales, Vladimir Propp calls this character type
the “donor” or “provider” because its precise function is to supply
the hero with something needed on the journey. Meeting with the
Mentor is the stage of the Hero's Journey in which the hero gains the
supplies, knowledge, and confidence needed to overcome fear and
commence the adventure.
139
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
HEROES AND MENTORS
Movies and stories of all kinds are constantly elaborating the relationship between the two archetypes of hero and Mentor.
The Karate Kid films, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and Stand
and Deliver are stories devoted entirely to the process of mentors
teaching students. Countless films such as Red River, Ordinary People,
Star Wars, and Fried Green Tomatoes reveal the vital force of Mentors
at key moments in the lives of heroes.
SOURCES OF WISDOM
Even if there is no actual character performing the many functions of
the Mentor archetype, heroes almost always make contact with some
source of wisdom before committing to the adventure. They may seek
out the experience of those who have gone before, or they may look
inside themselves for wisdom won at great cost in former adventures.
Either way, they are smart to consult the map of the adventure, looking for the records, charts, and ship’s logs of that territory. It’s only
prudent for wayfarers to stop and check the map before setting out
on the challenging, often disorienting, Road of Heroes.
For the storyteller, Meeting with the Mentor is a stage rich in
potential for conflict, involvement, humor, and tragedy. It’s based
in an emotional relationship, usually between a hero and a Mentor
or advisor of some kind, and audiences seem to enjoy relationships
in which the wisdom and experience of one generation is passed
on to the next. Everyone has had a relationship with a Mentor or
role model.
MENTORS IN FOLKLORE AND MYTH
Folklore is filled with descriptions of heroes meeting magical protectors who bestow gifts and guide them on the journey. We read of the
elves who help the shoemaker; the animals who help and protect little girls in Russian fairy tales; the seven dwarfs who give Snow White
140
MEETING WITH THE MENTOR
shelter; or Puss-in-Boots, the talking cat who helps his poor master
win a kingdom. All are projections of the powerful archetype of the
Mentor, helping and guiding the hero.
Heroes of mythology seek the advice and help of the witches,
wizards, witch doctors, spirits, and gods of their worlds. The heroes
of Homer's stories are guided by patron gods and goddesses who
give them magical aid. Some heroes are raised and trained by
magical beings that are somewhere between gods and men, such
as centaurs.
CHIRON: A PROTOTYPE
Many of the Greek heroes were mentored by the centaur Chiron,
a prototype for all Wise Old Men and Women. A strange mix of
man and horse, Chiron was foster-father and trainer to a whole army
of Greek heroes including Hercules, Actaeon, Achilles, Peleus, and
Aesculapius, the greatest surgeon of antiquity. In the person of Chiron, the Greeks stored many of their notions about what it means to
be a Mentor.
As a tule, centaurs are wild and savage creatures. Chiron was an
unusually kind and peaceful one, but he still kept some of his wild
horse nature. As a half man/half animal creature, he is linked to the
shamans of many cultures who dance in the skins of animals to get in
touch with animal power. Chiron is the energy and intuition of wild
nature, gentled and harnessed to teaching. Like the shamans, he is a
bridge between humans and the higher powers of nature and the universe. Mentors in stories often show that they are connected to nature
or to some other world of the spirit.
As a Mentor, Chiron led his heroes-in-training through the
thresholds of manhood by patiently teaching them the skills of
archery, poetry, surgery, and so on. He was not always well rewarded
for his efforts. His violence-prone pupil Hercules wounded him
with a magic arrow which made Chiron beg the gods for the mercy
141
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of death. But in the end, after a truly heroic sacrifice in which he
rescued Prometheus from the underworld by taking his place, Chiron received the highest distinction the Greeks could bestow. Zeus
made him a constellation and a sign of the zodiac — Sagittarius, a
centaur firing a bow. Clearly the Greeks had a high regard for teachers and Mentors.
MENTOR HIMSELF
The term Mentor comes from the character of that name in The
Odyssey. Mentor was the loyal friend of Odysseus, entrusted with
raising his son Telemachus while Odysseus made his long way back
from the Trojan War. Mentor has given his name to all guides and
trainers, but it’s really Athena, the goddess of wisdom, who works
behind the scenes to bring the energy of the Mentor archetype into
the story.
“The goddess with the flashing eyes” has a big crush on Odysseus,
and an interest in getting him home safely. She also looks out for his
son Telemachus. She finds the son’s story stuck in the opening scenes
(the Ordinary World) of The Odyssey when the household is overrun
by arrogant young suitors for his mother’s hand. Athena decides to
unstick the situation by taking human form. An important function
of the Mentor archetype is to get the story rolling.
First she assumes the appearance of a traveling warrior named
Mentes, to issue a stirring challenge to stand up to the suitors and
seek his father (Call to Adventure). Telemachus accepts the challenge but the suitors laugh him off and he is so discouraged he wants
to abandon the mission (Refusal of the Call). Once again the story
seems stuck, and Athena unsticks it by taking the form of Telemachus’
teacher Mentor. In this disguise she drums some courage into him and
helps him assemble a ship and crew. Therefore, even though Mentor
is the name we give to wise counselors and guides, it is really the goddess Athena who acts here.
142
MEETING WITH THE MENTOR
Athena is the full, undiluted energy of the archetype. If she
appeared in her true form, it would probably blast the skin off the bones
of the strongest hero. The gods usually speak to us through the filter of
other people who are temporarily filled with a godlike spirit. A good
teacher or Mentor is enthused about learning. The wonderful thing is
that this feeling can be communicated to students or to an audience.
The names Mentes and Mentor, along with our word “mental,”
stem from the Greek word for mind, menos, a marvelously flexible
word that can mean intention, force, or purpose as well as mind, spirit,
or remembrance. Mentors in stories act mainly on the mind of the
hero, changing her consciousness or redirecting her will. Even if physical gifts are given, Mentors strengthen the hero's mind to face an
ordeal with confidence. Menos also means courage. A good Mentor
should be encouraging.
AVOIDING MENTOR CLICHES
The audience is extremely familiar with the Mentor archetype. The
behaviors, attitudes, and functions of Wise Old Women and Men are
well known from thousands of stories, and it’s easy to fall into clichés
and stereotypes — kindly fairy godmothers and white-bearded wizards in tall Merlin hats. To combat this and keep your writing fresh
and surprising, defy the archetypes! Stand them on their heads, turn
them inside out, purposely do without them altogether to see what
happens. The absence of a Mentor creates special and interesting conditions for a hero. But be aware of the archetype’s existence, and the
audience’s familiarity with it.
MISDIRECTION
Audiences don’t mind being misled about a Mentor (or any character) from time to time. Real life is full of surprises about people who
turn out to be nothing like we first thought. The mask of the Mentor
can be used to trick a hero into entering a life of crime. This is how
143
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Fagin enlists little boys as pickpockets in Oliver Twist. The mask of
Mentor can be used to get a hero involved in a dangerous adventure,
unknowingly working for the villains. In Arabesque, Gregory Peck is
tricked into helping a ring of spies by a fake Wise Old Man. You can
make the audience think they are seeing a conventional, kindly, helpful Mentor, and then reveal that the character is actually something
quite different. Use the audience’s expectations and assumptions to
surprise them.
MENTOR-HERO CONFLICTS
The Mentor-hero relationship can take a tragic or deadly turn if the
hero is ungrateful or violence-prone. Despite the reputation of Hercules as a peerless hero, he has an alarming tendency to do harm to
his Mentors. In addition to painfully wounding Chiron, Hercules got
so frustrated at music lessons that he bashed in the head of his music
teacher Lycus with the first lyre ever made.
Sometimes a Mentor turns villain or betrays the hero. The movie
The Eiger Sanction shows an apparently benevolent Mentor (George
Kennedy) who surprisingly turns on his student hero (Clint Eastwood) and tries to kill him. The dwarf Regin, in Nordic myth, is at
first a Mentor to Sigurd the Dragonslayer and helpfully re-forges his
broken sword. But in the long run the helper turns out to be a doublecrosser. After the dragon is slain, Regin plots to kill Sigurd and keep
the treasure for himself.
Rumpelstiltskin is initially a fairy-tale Mentor who helps the heroine by making good on her father’s boast that she can spin straw into
gold. But the price he demands for his gift is too high — he wants her
baby. These stories teach us that not all Mentors are to be trusted, and
that it’s healthy to question a Mentor’s motives. It’s one way to distinguish good from bad advice.
Mentors sometimes disappoint the heroes who have admired
them during apprenticeship. In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Jimmy
144
MEETING WITH THE MENTOR
Stewart learns that his Mentor and role model, the noble Senator played by Claude Rains, is as crooked and cowardly as the rest
of Congress.
Mentors, like parents, may have a hard time letting go of their
charges. An overprotective Mentor can lead to a tragic situation. The
character of Svengali from the novel 7} rilby is a chilling portrait of a
Mentor who becomes so obsessed with his student that he dooms
them both.
MENTOR-DRIVEN STORIES
Once in a while an entire story is built around a Mentor. Goodbye,
Mr. Chips, the novel and film, is a whole story built on teaching. Mr.
Chips is the Mentor of thousands of boys and the hero of the story,
with his own series of Mentors.
The movie Barbarossa is a wise and funny look at a Mentor relationship sustained throughout the story. Its focus is the training of a
country boy (Gary Busey) by a legendary Western desperado (Willie Nelson). The young man’s learning is so complete that when the
movie ends, he is ready to take Barbarossa’s place as a larger-than-life
folk hero.
MENTOR AS EVOLVED HERO
Mentors can be regarded as heroes who have become experienced
enough to teach others. They have been down the Road of Heroes
one or more times, and they have acquired knowledge and skill which
can be passed on. The progression of images in the Tarot deck shows
how a hero evolves to become a Mentor. A hero begins as a Fool and
at various stages of the adventure rises through ranks of magician,
warrior, messenger, conqueror, lover, thief, ruler, hermit, and so on.
At last the hero becomes a Hierophant, a worker of miracles, a Mentor and guide to others, whose experience comes from surviving many
rounds of the Hero’s Journey.
145
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
CRITICAL INFLUENCE
Most often, teaching, training, and testing are only transient stages
of a hero’s progress, part of a larger picture. In many movies and stories the Wise Old Woman or Man is a passing influence on the hero.
But the Mentor’s brief appearance is critical to get the story past the
blockades of doubt and fear. Mentors may appear only two or three
times in a story. Glinda the Good Witch appears only three times in
The Wizard of Oz: 1) giving Dorothy the red shoes and a yellow path
to follow, 2) intervening to blanket the sleep-inducing poppies with
pure white snow, and 3) granting her wish to return home, with the
help of the magic red shoes. In all three cases her function is to get the
story unstuck by giving aid, advice, or magical equipment.
Mentors spring up in amazing variety and frequency because
they are so useful to storytellers. They reflect the reality that we all
have to learn the lessons of life from someone or something. Whether
embodied as a person, a tradition, or a code of ethics, the energy of the
archetype is present in almost every story, to get things rolling with
gifts, encouragement, guidance, or wisdom.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
Dorothy, like many heroes, encounters a series of Mentors of varying
shades. She learns something from almost everyone she meets, and all the
characters from whom she learns are in a sense Mentors.
Professor Marvel is the Mentor who reminds her that she is loved, and
sends her on her quest for “home,” a term that means far more than a
Kansas farmhouse. Dorothy has to learn to feel at home in her own soul,
and going back to face her problems is a step in that direction.
But the tornado flings her to Oz, where Dorothy encounters Glinda, the
good witch, a new Mentor for a new land. Glinda acquaints her with
the unfamiliar rules of Oz, gives her the magic gift of the ruby slippers,
and points her on the way of the Yellow Brick Road, the golden Road of
Heroes. She gives Dorothy a positive feminine role model to balance the
negativity of the Wicked Witch.
146
MEETING WITH THE MENTOR
The three magical figures that Dorothy meets along the way, a man of
straw, a man of tin, and a talking lion, are allies and Mentors who teach
her lessons about brains, heart, and courage. They are different models of masculine energy that she must incorporate in building her own
personality.
The Wizard himself is a Mentor, giving her a new Call to Adventure, the
impossible mission of fetching the witch's broomstick. He challenges Dorothy to face her greatest fear — the hostile feminine energy of the Witch.
The little dog Toto is a Mentor, too, in a way. Acting entirely on instinct,
he is her intuition, guiding her deeper into the adventure and back
out again.
e&
The concept of the Mentor archetype has many uses for the writer.
In addition to offering a force that can propel the story forward
and supply the hero with necessary motivation or equipment for
the journey, Mentors can provide humor or deep, tragic relationships. Some stories don’t need a special character solely dedicated
to perform the functions of this archetype, but at some point in
almost any story, the Mentor functions of helping the hero are performed by some character or force, temporarily wearing the mask
of the Mentor.
When writers get stuck, they may seek the help of Mentors just as
heroes do. They may consult writing teachers or seek inspiration from
the works of great writers. They may delve deep inside themselves to
the real sources of inspiration in the Self, the dwelling place of the
Muses. The best Mentor advice may be so simple: Breathe. Hang in
there. You're doing fine. You've got what it takes to handle any situation, somewhere inside you.
Writers should bear in mind that they are Mentors of a kind to
their readers, shamans who travel to other worlds and bring back stories to heal their people. Like Mentors, they teach with their stories
147
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
and give of their experience, passion, observation, and enthusiasm.
Writers, like shamans and Mentors, provide metaphors by which people guide their lives — a most valuable gift and a grave responsibility
for the writer.
It’s often the energy of the Mentor archetype that gets a hero past
fear and sends her to the brink of adventure, at the next stage of the
Hero’s Journey, the First Threshold.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. Who or what is the Mentor in The Silence of the Lambs? The Kings
Speech? A Star Is Born? Hunger Games?
2. Think of three long-running TV series. Are there Mentors in
these shows? What functions do these characters serve?
3. Is there a character in your story who is a full-blown Mentor?
Do other characters wear the mask of the Mentor at some point?
4. Would it benefit the story to develop a Mentor character if
there is none?
5. What Mentor functions can be found or developed in your story?
Does your hero need a Mentor?
6. Does your hero have some inner code of ethics or model of
behavior? Does your hero have a conscience and how does it manifest itself?
7. Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
portray a hero who has no apparent Mentor. He learns things
from people along the way, but there is no special character set
aside for that task. The third film in the series, Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade, introduces the character of Indy’s father, played
by Sean Connery. Is he a Mentor? Are all parents Mentors? Are
yours? In your stories, what is the attitude of your hero to the
Mentor energy?

STAGE FIVE:
CROSSING THE FIRST
elWeslsGiee
‘Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.”
— from The Wizard of Oz, screenplay by Noel Langley,
Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf
ow the hero stands at the very threshold of
the world of adventure, the Special World of
Act Two. The call has been heard, doubts and
fears have been expressed and allayed, and all
due preparations have been made. But the real
movement, the most critical action of Act One, still remains. Crossing the First Threshold is an act of the will in which the hero commits
wholeheartedly to the adventure.
APPROACHING THE THRESHOLD
Heroes typically don’t just accept the advice and gifts of their
Mentors and then charge into the adventure. Often their final
commitment is brought about through some external force which
changes the course or intensity of the story. This is equivalent to the
151]
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
famous “plot point” or “turning point” of the conventional three-act
movie structure. A villain may kill, harm, threaten, or kidnap someone close to the hero, sweeping aside all hesitation. Rough weather
may force the sailing of a ship, or the hero may be given a deadline to
achieve an assignment. The hero may run out of options, or discover
that a difficult choice must be made. Some heroes are “shanghaied”
into the adventure or pushed over the brink, with no choice but to
commit to the journey. In Thelma e& Louise, Louise’s impulsive killing of a man who is assaulting Thelma is the action that pushes the
women to Cross the First Threshold into a new world of being on
the run from the law.
An example of the externally imposed event is found in Hitchcock’s North by Northwest. Advertising man Roger Thornhill,
mistaken for a daring secret agent, has been trying his best to avoid his
Call to Adventure all through the first act. It takes a murder to get him
committed to the journey. A man he’s questioning at the U.N. building is killed in front of witnesses in such a way that everyone thinks
Roger did it. Now he is truly a “man on the run,’ escaping both from
the police and from the enemy agents who will stop at nothing to kill
him. The murder is the external event that pushes the story over the
First Threshold into the Special World, where the stakes are higher.
Internal events might trigger a Threshold Crossing as well.
Heroes come to decision points where their very souls are at stake,
where they must decide “Do I go on living my life as I always have, or
will I risk everything in the effort to grow and change?” In Ordinary
People the deteriorating life of the young hero Conrad gradually pressures him into making a choice, despite his fears, to see a therapist and
explore the trauma of his brother’s death.
Often a combination of external events and inner choices will
boost the story towards the second act. In Beverly Hills Cop Axel
Foley sees a childhood friend brutally executed by thugs, and is motivated to find the man who hired them. But it takes a separate moment
152
CROSSING THE FIRST THRESHOLD
of decision for him to overcome resistance and fully commit to the
adventure. In a brief scene in which his boss warns him off the case,
you see him make the inner choice to ignore the warning and enter
the Special World at any cost.
THRESHOLD GUARDIANS
As you approach the threshold you're likely to encounter beings who
try to block your way. They are called Threshold Guardians, a powerful and useful archetype. They may pop up to block the way and test
the hero at any point in a story, but they tend to cluster around the
doorways, gates, and narrow passages of threshold crossings. Axel
Foley’s Detroit police captain, who firmly forbids him from getting
involved in the investigation of the murder, is one such figure.
Threshold Guardians are part of the training of any hero. In
Greek myth, the three-headed monster dog Cerberus guards the
entrance to the underworld, and many a hero has had to figure out a
way past his jaws. The grim ferryman Charon who guides souls across
the River Styx is another Threshold Guardian who must be appeased
with a gift of a penny.
The task for heroes at this point is often to figure out some way
around or through these guardians. Often their threat is just an illusion, and the solution is simply to ignore them or to push through
them with faith. Other Threshold Guardians must be absorbed or
their hostile energy must be reflected back onto them. The trick
may be to realize that what seems like an obstacle may actually be
the means of climbing over the threshold. Threshold Guardians who
seem to be enemies may be turned into valuable allies.
Sometimes the guardians of the First Threshold simply need to
be acknowledged. They occupy a difficult niche and it wouldn't be
polite to pass through their territory without recognizing their power
and their important role of keeping the gate. It’s a little like tipping a
doorman or paying a ticket-taker at a theatre.

THE CROSSING
Sometimes this step merely signifies we have reached the border of
the two worlds. We must take the leap of faith into the unknown or
else the adventure will never really begin.
Countless movies illustrate the border between two worlds
with the crossing of physical barriers such as doors, gates, arches,
bridges, deserts, canyons, walls, cliffs, oceans, or rivers. In many
Westerns thresholds are clearly marked by river or border crossings.
In the adventure Gunga Din, the heroes must leap off a high cliff to
escape a horde of screaming cult members at the end of Act One.
They are bonded by this leap into the unknown, a Threshold Crossing signifying their willingness to explore the Special World of Act
Two together.
In the olden days of film, the transition between Act One and
Act Two was often marked by a brief fade-out, a momentary darkening of the screen which indicated passage of time or movement in
space. The fade-out was equivalent to the curtain coming down in the
theatre so the stagehands can change the set and props to create a new
locale or show elapse of time.
Nowadays it’s common for editors to cut sharply from Act One
to Act Two. Nevertheless the audience will still experience a noticeable shift in energy at the Threshold Crossing. A song, a music cue
or a drastic visual contrast may help signal the transition. The pace of
the story may pick up. Entering a new terrain or structure may signal
the change of worlds. In 4 League of Their Own the Crossing is the
moment the women enter a big-league baseball stadium, a marked
contrast from the country ball fields where they’ve been playing.
The actual Crossing of the Threshold may be a single moment,
or it may be an extended passage in a story. In Lawrence of Arabia,
T. E. Lawrence’s ordeals in crossing “the Sun’s Anvil,” a treacherous
stretch of desert, are an elaboration of this stage into a substantial sequence.
154
CROSSING THE FIRST THRESHOLD
The Crossing takes a certain kind of courage from the hero. He
is like the Fool in the Tarot deck: one foot out over a precipice, about
to begin free-fall into the unknown.
That special courage is called making the leap of faith. Like
jumping out of an airplane, the act is irrevocable. There’s no turning back now. The leap is made on faith, the trust that somehow we'll
land safely.
ROUGH LANDING
Heroes don’t always land gently. They may crash in the other world,
literally or figuratively. The leap of faith may turn into a crisis of faith
as romantic illusions about the Special World are shattered by first
contact with it. A bruised hero may pick herself up and ask, “Is that
all there is?” The passage to the Special World may be exhausting,
frustrating, or disorienting.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
A tremendous natural force rises up to hurl Dorothy over the First Threshold. She is trying to get home but the tornado sends her on a detour to a
Special World where she will learn what “home” really means. Dorothy’
last name, Gale, is a wordplay that links her to the storm. In symbolic language, its her own stirred-up emotions that have generated this twister.
Her old idea of home, the house, is wrenched up by the tornado and carried to a far-off land where a new personality structure can be built.
As she passes through the transition zone, Dorothy sees familiar sights
but in unfamiliar circumstances. Cows fly through the air, men row a
boat through the storm, and Miss Gulch on her bicycle turns into the
Wicked Witch. Dorothy has nothing she can count on now but Toto —
her instincts.
The house comes down with a crash. Dorothy emerges to find a world startlingly different from Kansas, populated by the Little Men and Women of
fairy tales. A Mentor appears magically when Glinda floats onto the scene
in a transparent bubble. She begins to teach Dorothy about the strange
ways of the new land, and points out that the crash of Dorothy's house
155
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
has killed a bad witch. Dorothy's old personality has been shattered by
the uprooting of her old notion of home.
Glinda gives a mentor’ gifts, the ruby slippers, and new direction for
the quest. To get home, Dorothy must first see the Wizard, that is, get
in touch with her own higher Self. Glinda gives a specific path, the Yellow Brick Road, and sends her over another threshold, knowing she will
have to make friends, confront foes, and be tested before she can reach her
ultimate goal.
oe
The First Threshold is the turning point at which the adventure begins
in earnest, at the end of Act One. According to a corporate metaphor
in use at Disney, a story is like an airplane flight, and Act One is the
process of loading, fueling, taxiing, and rumbling down the runway
towards take-off. The First Threshold is the moment the wheels leave
the ground and the plane begins to fly. If you've never flown before,
it may take a while to adjust to being in the air. We'll describe that
process of adjustment in the next phase of the Hero’s Journey: Tests,
Allies, Enemies.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. What is the First Threshold of Dances with Wolves? Braveheart?
12 Years a Slave? American Sniper? How does the audience know
we've gone from one world to another? How does the energy of
the story feel different?
2. Is your hero willing to enter the adventure or not? How does this
affect the Threshold Crossing?
3. Are there guardian forces at the Threshold and how do they make
the hero’s leap of faith more difficult?
4. How does the hero deal with Threshold Guardians? What does
the hero learn by Crossing the Threshold?
156
CROSSING THE FIRST THRESHOLD
5. What have been the Thresholds in your own life? How did you
experience them? Were you even aware you were crossing a threshold into a Special World at the time?
6. By Crossing a Threshold, what options is a hero giving up? Will
these unexplored options come back to haunt the hero later?

STAGE SIX:
TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES
oe
“See, you got three or ‘four good pals, why then you got
yourself a tribe — there ain't nothin’ stronger than that.”
— from Young Guns, screenplay by John Fusco
ow the hero fully enters the mysterious, exciting
Special World which Joseph Campbell called
“a dream landscape of curiously fluid, ambiguous forms, where he must survive a succession
of trials.” It’s a new and sometimes frightening
experience for the hero. No matter how many schools he has been
through, he’s a freshman all over again in this new world.
CONTRAST
The audience’s first impressions of the Special World should strike a
sharp contrast with the Ordinary World. Think of Eddie Murphy’s
first look at the Special World of Beverly Hills Cop, which makes such a
drastic contrast to his former world of Detroit. Even if the hero remains
physically in the same place throughout the story, there is movement
and change as new emotional territory is explored. A Special World,
even a figurative one, has a different feel, a different rhythm, different
159
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
priorities and values, and different rules. In Father of the Bride or Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner, while there is no physical threshold, there's
definitely a crossing into a Special World with new conditions.
When a submarine dives, a wagon train leaves St. Louis, or
the Starship Enterprise leaves the earth, the conditions and rules of
survival change. Things are often more dangerous, and the price of
mistakes is higher.
TESTING
The most important function of this period of adjustment to the
Special World is testing. Storytellers use this phase to test the hero,
putting her through a series of trials and challenges that are meant to
prepare her for greater ordeals ahead.
Joseph Campbell illustrates this stage with the tale of Psyche,
who is put through a fairy-tale-like series of Tests before winning back
her lost love, Cupid (Eros). This tale has been wisely interpreted by
Robert A. Johnson in his book on feminine psychology, She. Psyche
is given three seemingly impossible tasks by Cupid’s jealous mother
Venus and passes the Tests with the help of beings to whom she has
been kind along the way. She has made Allies.
The Tests at the beginning of Act Two are often difficult obstacles,
but they don’t have the maximum life-and-death quality of later events.
If the adventure were a college learning experience, Act One would be a
series of entrance exams, and the Test stage of Act Two would be a series
of pop quizzes, meant to sharpen the hero’s skill in specific areas and
prepare her for the more rigorous midterm and final exams coming up.
The Tests may be a continuation of the Mentor’s training. Many
Mentors accompany their heroes this far into the adventure, coaching them for the big rounds ahead.
The Tests may also be built into the architecture or landscape
of the Special World. This world is usually dominated by a villain or
Shadow who is careful to surround his world with traps, barricades,
160
TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES
and checkpoints. It’s common for heroes to fall into traps here or trip
the Shadow’s security alarms. How the hero deals with these traps is
part of the Testing.
ALLIES AND ENEMIES
Another function of this stage is the making of Allies or Enemies.
It’s natural for heroes just arriving in the Special World to spend
some time figuring out who can be trusted and relied upon for special services, and who is not to be trusted. This too is a kind of Test,
examining if the hero is a good judge of character.
ALLIES
Heroes may walk into the Test stage looking for information, but they
may walk out with new friends or Allies. In Shane, a shaky partnership between the gunfighter Shane (Alan Ladd) and the farmer (Van
Heflin) is cemented into a real friendship by the shared ordeal of a
saloon-shattering brawl. When John Dunbar in Dances With Wolves
crosses the threshold into the Special World of the frontier, he gradually makes alliances with Kicking Bear (Graham Greene) and the wolf
he names Two Socks.
SIDEKICKS
Westerns frequently make use of a long-standing bond between a hero
and a sidekick, an Ally who generally rides with the hero and supports
his adventures. The Lone Ranger has Tonto; Zorro has the servant Bernardo; the Cisco Kid has Pancho. These pairings of hero and sidekick
can be found throughout myth and literature: Sherlock Holmes and Dr.
Watson, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Prince Hal and Falstaff, or
the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and his wild companion Enkidu.
These close Allies of the hero may provide comic relief as well as
assistance. Comical sidekicks, played by character actors such as Walter Brennan, Gabby Hayes, Fuzzy Knight, and Slim Pickens, provide
161
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
humor lacking in their stalwart, serious heroes they accompany. Such
figures may freely cross the boundaries between Mentor and Trickster,
sometimes aiding the hero and acting as his conscience, sometimes
comically goofing up or causing mischief.
TEAMS
The Testing stage may also provide the opportunity for the forging of a team. Many stories feature multiple heroes or a hero backed
up by a team of characters with special skills or qualities. The early
phases of Act Two may cover the recruiting of a team, or give an
opportunity for the team to make plans and rehearse a difficult operation. The World War II adventure films The Dirty Dozen and The
Great Escape show the heroes bonding into a coherent team before
tackling the main event of the story. In the Testing stage the hero may
have to struggle against rivals for control of the group. The strengths
and flaws of the team members are revealed during Testing.
In a romance, the Testing stage might be the occasion for a first
date or for some shared experience that begins to build the relationship, such as the tennis match between Diane Keaton and Woody
Allen in Annie Hall.
ENEMIES
Heroes can also make bitter enmities at this stage. They may encounter the Shadow or his servants. The hero’s appearance in the Special
World may tip the Shadow to his arrival and trigger a chain of threatening events. The cantina sequence in Star Wars sets up a conflict
with the villain Jabba the Hutt which culminates in The Empire
Strikes Back.
Enemies include both the villains or antagonists of stories and
their underlings. Enemies may perform functions of other archetypes
such as the Shadow, the Trickster, the Threshold Guardian, and sometimes the Herald.
162
TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES
THE RIVAL
A special type of Enemy is the rival, the hero’s competition in love,
sports, business, or some other enterprise. The rival is usually not out
to kill the hero, but is just trying to defeat him in the competition.
In the film The Last of the Mohicans, Major Duncan Hayward is the
rival of hero Nathaniel Poe because they both want the same woman,
Cora Munro. The plot of Honeymoon in Vegas revolves around a similar rivalry between the hapless hero (Nicolas Cage) and his gambler
opponent (James Caan).
NEW RULES
The new rules of the Special World must be learned quickly by the hero
and the audience. As Dorothy enters the Land of Oz, she is bewildered
when Glinda the Good asks, “Are you a good witch or a bad witch?” In
Dorothy's Ordinary World of Kansas, there are only bad witches, but in
the Special World of Oz, witches can also be good, and fly in pink bubbles instead of on broomsticks. Another Test of the hero is how quickly
she can adjust to the new rules of the Special World.
At this stage a Western may impose certain conditions on people
entering a town or a bar. In Unforgiven, guns cannot be worn in the
sheriff’s territory. This restriction can draw the hero into conflicts. A
hero may enter a bar to discover that the town is totally polarized by
two factions: the cattlemen versus the farmers, the Earps versus the
Clantons, the bounty hunters versus the sheriff, and so on. In the pressure cooker of the saloon, people size each other up and take sides for
the coming showdown. The cantina sequence in Star Wars draws on
the images we all have of Western saloons as places for reconnaissance,
challenges, alliances, and the learning of new rules.
WATERING HOLES
Why do so many heroes pass through bars and saloons at this point
in the stories? The answer lies in the hunting metaphor of the Hero’s
163
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Journey. Upon leaving the Ordinary World of village or den, hunters
will often head straight for a watering hole to look for game. Predators sometimes follow the muddy tracks left by game who come
down to drink. The watering hole is a natural congregating place and a
good spot to observe and get information. It’s no accident that we call
neighborhood saloons and cocktail lounges our “local watering holes.”
The crossing of the First Threshold may have been long, lonely,
and dry. Bars are natural spots to recuperate, pick up gossip, make
friends, and confront Enemies. They also allow us to observe people
under pressure, when true character is revealed. How Shane handles
himself in a bar fight convinces a farmer to become his Ally and stand
up to the bullying cattlemen. In the tense barroom confrontations in
Star Wars, Luke Skywalker sees flashes of Obi Wan Kenobi’s spiritual
power and Han Solo’s “look out for Number One” mentality. The
bar can be a microcosm of the Special World, a place through which
everyone must pass, sooner or later, like the saloon in The Life and
Times of Judge Roy Bean. “Everybody Comes to Rick’s,’ says the title
of the play on which Casablanca is based.
Bars play host to other activities including music, flirting, and
gambling. This stage in a story, whether it takes place in a bar or not,
is a good place for a musical sequence that announces the mood of
the Special World. A nightclub act may allow the introduction of a
romantic interest, as in Jessica Rabbit's sensational torch song in Who
Framed Roger Rabbit? Music can express the dualities of the Special
World as well. At this stage in Casablanca the polarities are movingly
presented in a musical duel between the passionate “Marseillaise”
sung by the French patriots and the brutal “Deutschland uber Alles”
sung by the Nazis.
In the lonely outposts of adventure, saloons, or their equivalent
may be the only places for sexual intrigue. Bars can be the arena for
flirting, romance, or prostitution. A hero may strike up a relationship
in a bar to get information, and incidentally acquire an Ally or a lover.
164
TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES
Gambling and saloons go together, and games of chance are a
natural feature of the Testing stage. Heroes may want to consult the
oracles to see how luck will favor them. They want to learn about the
wheel of fortune, and how luck can be coaxed their way. Through a
game the stakes can be raised or a fortune can be lost. In the Hindu
epic The Mahabharata, a cosmic family feud is set in motion by a
rigged game of chance between two sets of brothers. (The bad
guys cheat.)
LAEVAIZARD OF OZ
Of course not all heroes go to bars at this stage of the journey. Dorothy
encounters her Tests, Allies, and Enemies on the Yellow Brick Road. Like
Psyche or the heroes of many fairy tales she is wise enough to know that
requests for aid on the road should be honored with an open heart. She
earns the loyalty of the Scarecrow by getting him unhooked from his post
and by helping him learn to walk. Meanwhile she learns that her Enemy,
the Wicked Witch, shadows her at every turn and waits for the chance to
strike. The Witch influences some grumpy apple trees to become Enemies
to Dorothy and the Scarecrow. The Scarecrow proves his worthiness to be
on the team by outwitting the trees. He taunts them into throwing apples,
which he and Dorothy pick up to eat.
Dorothy wins the affection of another Ally, the Tin Woodsman, by oiling
his joints and listening sympathetically to his sad story of having no heart.
The Witch appears again, showing her enmity for Dorothy and her Allies
by hurling a fireball at them.
To protect her dog Toto, Dorothy stands up to the blustering of the Cowardly Lion, a potential Enemy or Threshold Guardian, and ends up
making him an Ally.
The battle lines are clearly drawn. Dorothy has learned the rules of the
Special World and has passed many Tests. Protected by Allies and on
guard against declared Enemies, she is ready to approach the central
source of power in the Land of Oz.

165
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The phase of Tests, Allies, and Enemies in stories is useful for “getting
to know you” scenes where the characters get acquainted with each
other and the audience learns more about them. This stage also allows
the hero to accumulate power and information in preparation for the
next stage: Approach to the Inmost Cave.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. What is the Testing phase of Les Miserables? The Hobbit? Jurassic
Park? The Shape of Water? Why do heroes pass through a period
of Tests? Why don’t they just go right to the main event after
entering Act Two?
2. How does your story’s Special World differ from the Ordinary
World? How can you increase the contrast?
3. In what ways is your hero Tested, and when does she make Allies
or Enemies? Keep in mind there is no “right” way. The needs of
the story may dictate when alliances are made.
4. Are there loner heroes who have no Allies?
5. Is your hero a single character or a group such as a platoon, a
crew, a family, or a gang? If it is an “ensemble piece” like The
Breakfast Club or The Big Chill, when does the team become a
coherent group?
6. How does your hero react to the Special World, with its strange
rules and unfamiliar people?

eroes, having made the adjustment to the Special World, now go on to seek its heart. They
pass into an intermediate region between the
border and the very center of the Hero’s Journey. On the way they find another mysterious
zone with its own Threshold Guardians, agendas, and tests. This is the Approach to the Inmost Cave, where soon
they will encounter supreme wonder and terror. It’s time to make
final preparations for the central ordeal of the adventure. Heroes at
this point are like mountaineers who have raised themselves to a base
camp by the labors of Testing, and are about to make the final assault
on the highest peak.
169
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
FUNCTIONS OF APPROACH
In modern storytelling, certain special functions naturally fall into
this zone of Approach. As heroes near the gates of a citadel deep
within the Special World, they may take time to make plans, do reconnaissance on the enemy, reorganize or thin out the group, fortify and
arm themselves, and have a last laugh and a final cigarette before going
over the top into no-man’s-land. The student studies for the midterm.
The hunter stalks the game to its hiding place. Adventurers squeeze in
a love scene before tackling the central event of the movie.
COURTSHIP
The Approach can be an arena for elaborate courtship rituals. A
romance may develop here, bonding hero and beloved before they
encounter the main ordeal. In North by Northwest, Cary Grant
meets a beautiful woman (Eva Marie Saint) on a train as he escapes
from the police and the enemy spies. He doesn’t know she works
for the evil spies and has been assigned to lure him into their trap.
However, her seduction backfires and she finds herself actually falling in love with him. Later, thanks to this scene of bonding, she
becomes his Ally.
THE BOLD APPROACH
Some heroes boldly stride up to the castle door and demand to be let
in. Confident, committed heroes will take this Approach. Axel Foley
in Beverly Hills Cop crashes into the precincts of his enemy a number of times at the Approach phase, conning his way past Threshold
Guardians and flaunting his intention to upset his opponent’s world.
Cary Grant in Gunga Din marches into the Inmost Cave of his
antagonists, a cult of assassins, singing an English drinking song at
the top of his lungs. His bold Approach is not pure arrogance: He
puts on the outrageous show to buy time for his friend Gunga Din
to slip away and summon the British army. In true heroic fashion
170
APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
Grant's character is sacrificing himself and tempting death on behalf
of the group.
The Approach of Clint Eastwood's character in Unforgiven is
not so much arrogant as ignorant. He rides into the Inmost Cave of
the town during a rainstorm, and is unable to see a sign forbidding
firearms. This brings him to an ordeal, a beating by the sheriff (Gene
Hackman) that almost kills him.
PREPARATION FOR THE ORDEAL
Approach may be a time of further reconnaissance and informationgathering, or a time of dressing and arming for an ordeal. Gunfighters
check their weapons, bullfighters dress carefully in their suits of lights.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
The Wizard of Oz has such a well-developed Approach section that
we'll use it throughout this chapter to illuminate some of the functions of this stage.
OBSTACLES
Having made some Allies in the Testing stage, Dorothy and friends
leave the woods on the border of Oz and immediately see the glittering Emerald City of their dreams. They Approach in joy, but before
they reach their goal, they face a series of obstacles and challenges that
will bond them as a group, and prepare them for the life-and-death
struggle yet to come.
BEWARE OF ILLUSIONS
First they are put to sleep by a field of poppies sown by the Wicked
Witch’s magic. They are brought back to consciousness by a blanket
of snow, courtesy of Glinda the Good.
The message for the hero is clear: Don’t be seduced by illusions
and perfumes, stay alert, don’t fall asleep on the march.
171
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
THRESHOLD GUARDIANS
Dorothy and friends reach the City, only to find their way blocked by
a rude sentry, a perfect Threshold Guardian (who looks suspiciously
like Professor Marvel from Act One). He is a satirical figure, an exaggerated image of a bureaucrat whose job is to enforce stupid, pointless
rules. Dorothy identifies herself as the one who dropped a house on
the Wicked Witch of the East, and she has the Ruby Slippers to prove
it. This wins the respect of the sentry who admits them immediately,
saying, “Well that’s a horse of a different color!”
Message: Past experience on the journey may be the hero’s passport to new lands. Nothing is wasted, and every challenge of the past
strengthens and informs us for the present. We win respect for having made it this far.
The satire of bureaucratic nonsense reminds us that few heroes
are exempt from the tolls and rituals of the Special World. Heroes
must either pay the price of admission or find a way around the obstacles, as Dorothy does.
ANOTHER SPECIAL WORLD
Dorothy and company enter the wonderland of the City, where everything is green except for a horse pulling a carriage, the famous Horse
of a Different Color who changes hue every time you look at him. The
Driver also looks like Professor Marvel.
Message: You've entered yet another little Special World, with
different rules and values. You may encounter a series of these like
Chinese boxes, one inside the other, a series of shells protecting
some central source of power. The multicolored horse is a signal
that rapid change is coming. The detail of several characters looking
alike, or the same character taking a variety of roles, is a reminder
we are in a dream world ruled by forces of comparison, association,
and transformation. The protean changes of Professor Marvel suggest that a single powerful mind is at work in Oz, or that Dorothy’s
172
APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
dream, if that’s what it is, has been deeply influenced by his personality. Professor Marvel has become an animus figure for Dorothy:
a focus for her projections about mature male energy. Her father is
dead or absent and the male figures around the farm, Uncle Henry
and the three farmhands, are weak. She is seeking an image of what
a father can be, and projects Professor Marvel’s paternal energy onto
every authority figure she sees. If the Good Witch Glinda is a surrogate mother or positive anima for her, these variations of Professor
Marvel are surrogate fathers.
BE PREPARED
Dorothy and friends are primped, pampered, and prepared for their
meeting with the Wizard in the beauty parlors and machine shops of
the Emerald City.
Message: Heroes know they are facing a great ordeal, and are
wise to make themselves as ready as they'll ever be, like warriors polishing and sharpening their weapons, or students doing final drills
before a big exam.
WARNING
Our heroes, feeling pretty good now, go out singing about how the
day is laughed away in the merry old Land of Oz. Just then the Witch
screeches over the city, skywriting from her broomstick, “Surrender
Dorothy!” The people back away in terror, leaving our heroes alone
outside the Wizard’s door.
Message: It’s good for heroes to go into the main event in a state
of balance, with confidence tempered by humility and awareness of
the danger. No matter how hysterical the celebrations in Oz, they
always seem to be damped by an appearance of the Witch, a real party
pooper. She is a deep disturbance in Dorothy’s psyche which will ruin
every pleasurable moment until dealt with decisively. The isolation of
the heroes is typical. Like Gary Cooper trying to line up support from
173
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
cowardly townspeople in High Noon, heroes may find good-time companions fading away when the going gets tough.
ANOTHER THRESHOLD
Our heroes knock at the Wizard’s door and an even ruder sentry,
another ringer for Professor Marvel, sticks his head out. His orders
are “Not nobody, not no how” is to get in to see the Wizard. Only the
information that he’s dealing with “the Witch’s Dorothy” convinces
him to go confer with the Wizard. While he’s gone, the Lion sings “If
I Were King of the Forest,” expressing his aspirations.
Message: The credentials of experience may have to be presented
repeatedly at successive rungs of power. When delayed by obstacles,
heroes do well to get acquainted with their fellow adventurers and
learn of their hopes and dreams.
EMOTIONAL APPEAL TO A GUARDIAN
The Sentry returns to report that the Wizard says, “Go away.”
Dorothy and her companions break down and lament. Now they'll
never have their wishes met and Dorothy will never get home. The sad
story brings floods of tears to the Sentry’s eyes, and he lets them in.
Message: Sometimes, when the passport of experience no longer
works to get you past a gate, an emotional appeal can break down the
defenses of Threshold Guardians. Establishing a bond of human feeling may be the key.
AN IMPOSSIBLE TEST
Our heroes cross yet another threshold, being ushered into the throne
room of Oz by the Sentry, now their friend. Oz himself is one of the
most terrifying images ever put on film — the gigantic head of an
angry old man, surrounded by flames and thunder. He can grant your
wish, but like the kings of fairy tales, is miserly with his power. He
imposes impossible tests in hopes that you will go away and leave him
174
APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
alone. Dorothy and friends are given the apparently unachievable task
of fetching the broomstick of the Wicked Witch.
Message: It’s tempting to think you can just march into foreign territory, take the prize, and leave. The awesome image of Oz
reminds us that heroes are challenging a powerful status quo, which
may not share their dreams and goals. That status quo may even live
inside them in strong habits or neuroses that must be overcome
before facing the main ordeal. Oz, Professor Marvel in his most
powerful and frightening form, is a negative animus figure, the dark
side of Dorothy’s idea of a father. Dorothy must deal with her confused feelings about male energy before she can confront her deeper
feminine nature.
The status quo might be an aging generation or ruler, reluctant
to give up power, or a parent unwilling to admit the child is grown.
The Wizard at this point is like a harassed father, grouchy about being
interrupted and having demands put on him by youth. This angry
parental force must be appeased or dealt with in some way before the
adventure can proceed. We must all pass tests to earn the approval of
parental forces.
Parents sometimes set impossible conditions on winning their
love and acceptance. You can’t ever seem to please them. Sometimes
the very people you naturally turn to in a crisis will push you away.
You may have to face the big moment alone.
SHAMANIC TERRITORY
The heroes pass on to the eerie region surrounding the Wicked
Witch’s castle. Here they encounter more Threshold Guardians,
in the witch’s creepy servants, the flying monkeys. Dorothy is kidnapped and flown away by the monkeys, and her companions are
beaten and scattered. Tin Woodsman is dented and Scarecrow is
torn limb from limb.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Message: As heroes Approach the Inmost Cave, they should
know they are in shaman’s territory, on the edge between life and
death. The Scarecrow being torn to pieces and scattered by the monkeys recalls the visions and dreams that signal selection as a shaman.
Shamans-to-be often dream of being dismembered by heavenly spirits
and reassembled into the new form of a shaman. Dorothy being flown
away by the monkeys is just the sort of thing that happens to shamans
when they travel to other worlds.
COMPLICATIONS
The terrorized heroes are discouraged and confused after the monkey
attack. Scarecrow’s scattered limbs are reassembled by the Tin Woodsman and Cowardly Lion.
Heroes may have disheartening setbacks at this stage while
approaching the supreme goal. Such reversals of fortune are called
dramatic complications. Though they may seem to tear us apart, they
are only a further test of our willingness to proceed. They also allow
us to put ourselves back together in a more effective form for traveling in this unfamiliar terrain.
HIGHER STAKES
Dorothy is now trapped in the castle. The Witch, mirroring the action
of her look-alike Miss Gulch, crams Toto into a basket and threatens
to throw him in the river unless Dorothy turns over the Ruby Slippers. Dorothy agrees to hand them over but the Witch is zapped by
Glinda’s protective spell when she tries to take the shoes. The Witch
realizes she'll never get the shoes while Dorothy’s alive and sets before
her the hourglass with its rushing red sand like dried blood. When
the last grain runs out, Dorothy will die.
Message: Another function of the Approach stage is to up the
stakes and rededicate the team to its mission. The audience may need
to be reminded of the “ticking clock” or the “time bomb” of the
176
APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
story. The urgency and life-and-death quality of the issue need to be
underscored,
Toto in the basket is a repeated symbol of intuition stifled by the
negative anima of the Witch/Miss Gulch. Dorothy’s fear of her own
intuitive side keeps stuffing away her creativity and confidence, but it
keeps popping up again, like Toto.
The Ruby Slippers are a deep dream symbol, representing both
Dorothy’s means of getting around in Oz and her identity, her
unassailable integrity. The shoes are a reassuring Mentor’s gift, the
knowledge that you are a unique being with a core that cannot be
shaken by outside events. They are like Ariadne’s Thread in the story
of Theseus and the Minotaur, a connection with a positive, loving
anima that gets you through the darkest of labyrinths.
REORGANIZATION
Toto escapes from the basket as he did in Act One and runs out of
the castle to join forces with the three friends who are still piecing
together the Scarecrow. Toto leads them to the castle, where they are
daunted at the task of getting the helpless Dorothy out of the forbidding, well-defended place. The responsibility of moving the adventure
forward has fallen to Dorothy’s three Allies; this place is so terrible
that there’s no help here from kindly wizards and witches. They have
gotten by as clowns; now they must become heroes.
Message: Toto again acts as Dorothy’s intuition, sensing that it’s
time to call on Allies and lessons learned to get her out of a trap. The
Approach stage is also a time to reorganize a group: to promote some
members, sort out living, dead, and wounded, assign special missions,
and so on. Archetypal masks may need to be changed as characters are
made to perform new functions.
With her freedom of action removed, Dorothy has switched
archetypal masks here, trading the Hero mask for that of the Victim, the archetype of helplessness. The three companions have also
177
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
traded masks, being promoted from Trickster clowns or Allies,
to full-fledged Heroes who will carry the action for a while. The
audience may find that assumptions about the characters are being
overturned as surprising new qualities emerge under the pressure
of Approach.
The sense that the heroes must face some things without the help
of protective spirits is reminiscent of many mythic tales of trips to the
underworld. Human heroes often have to go it alone on a mission
from the gods. They must travel to the land of the dead where the gods
themselves are afraid to walk. We may consult doctors or therapists,
friends or advisors, but there are some places where our Mentors can’t
go and we are on our own.
HEAVY DEFENSES
Scarecrow, Lion, and Tin Woodsman now creep up to observe the
threshold of the Inmost Cave itself, the drawbridge of the Wicked
Witch’s castle, defended by a whole army of ferocious-looking Threshold Guardians, wearing bearskin hats and gloves and growling their
grim marching song.
Message: Heroes can expect the villain’s headquarters to be
defended with animal-like ferocity. The castle itself, with its barred
gate and drawbridge like a devouring mouth and tongue, is a symbol
of the elaborate fortifications around an all-consuming neurosis. The
defenses around the Witch’s negative anima make the Wizard’s guards
and palace look inviting by comparison.
WHO IS THE HERO AT THIS POINT?
The three reluctant heroes evaluate the situation. The Lion wants to
run, but the Scarecrow has a plan which requires Lion to be the leader.
This makes sense since he is the most ferocious-looking, but he still
wants to be talked out of it.
178
APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
Message: The Approach is a good time to recalibrate your team,
express misgivings, and give encouragement. Team members make
sure all are in agreement about goals, and determine that the right
people are in the right jobs. There may even be bitter battles for dominance among the group at this stage, as pirates or thieves fight for
control of the adventure.
However, here the Cowardly Lion’s efforts to escape responsibility are comic, and point up another function of the Approach: comic
relief. This may be the last chance to relax and crack a joke because
things are about to get deadly serious in the Supreme Ordeal phase.
GET INTO YOUR OPPONENT'S MIND
As part of their Approach, the three heroes try to cook up a plan as
they move closer to the gate. Three sentries attack them, and after a
struggle in which costumes fly through the air, our heroes emerge
wearing the uniforms and bearskin hats of their enemies. In this disguise, they join the platoon of marching sentries and stride right into
the castle.
Message: Here the heroes employ the device of “getting into the
skin” of the Threshold Guardians before them. Like the Plains Indians
donning buffalo robes to creep close to their prey, the heroes literally
put on the skins of their opponents and slip in among them. When in
Rome, do as the Romans do. This aspect of the Approach teaches that
we must get into the minds of those who seem to stand in our way. If
we understand or empathize with them, the job of getting past them
or absorbing their energy is much easier. We can turn their attacks
into opportunities to get into their skin. Heroes may also put on disguises to conceal their real intentions as they get close to the Inmost
Cave of the opponent.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
BREAKTHROUGH
The three heroes now discard their disguises and make their way to
the chamber of the castle where Dorothy is imprisoned. The Tin
Woodsman uses his axe to chop through the door.
Message: At some point it may be necessary to use force to break
through the final veil to the Inmost Cave. The hero's own resistance
and fear may have to be overcome by a violent act of will.
NO EXIT
With Dorothy rescued, and the foursome united again, they now
turn their attention to escape. But they are blocked in all directions
by the witch’s guards.
Message: No matter how heroes try to escape their fate, sooner or
later the exits are closed off and the life-and-death issue must be faced.
With Dorothy and companions “trapped like rats,” the Approach to
the Inmost Cave is complete.
ee
The Approach encompasses all the final preparations for the Supreme
Ordeal. It often brings heroes to a stronghold of the opposition, a
defended center where every lesson and Ally of the journey so far
comes into play. New perceptions are put to the test, and the final
obstacles to reaching the heart are overcome, so that the Supreme
Ordeal may begin.

APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
. Campbell says that in myths, the crossing of the First Threshold
is often followed by the hero passing through “the belly of the
whale.” He cites stories from many cultures of heroes being swallowed by giant beasts. In what sense are the heroes “in the belly of
the whale” in in the early stages of Act Two in Thelma & Louise?
Unforgiven? Dolemite Is My Name? How to Train your Dragon?
. Campbell describes several ideas or actions surrounding the
major ordeal of a myth: “Meeting with the Goddess,” “Woman
as Temptress,” “Atonement with the Father.’ In what ways are
these ideas part of Approaching the Inmost Cave?
. In your own story, what happens between entering the Special
World and reaching a central crisis in that world? What special
preparations lead up to the crisis?
. Does conflict build, and do the obstacles get more difficult or
interesting ?
. Do your heroes want to turn back at this stage, or are they fully
committed to the adventure now?
. In what ways is the hero, in facing external challenges, also
encountering inner demons and defenses?
. Is there a physical Inmost Cave or headquarters of the villain which the heroes Approach? Or is there some emotional
equivalent?

JAMES BOND: What do you expect me to do, Goldfinger?

— from Goldfinger, screenplay by
Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn
ow the hero stands in the deepest chamber of
the Inmost Cave, facing the greatest challenge
and the most fearsome opponent yet. This the
real heart of the matter, what Joseph Campbell
called the Ordeal. It is the mainspring of the
heroic form and the key to its magic power.
DEATH AND REBIRTH
The simple secret of the Ordeal is this: Heroes must die so that they
can be reborn. The dramatic movement that audiences enjoy more
than any other is death and rebirth. In some way in every story, heroes
face death or something like it: their greatest fears, the failure of an
enterprise, the end of a relationship, the death of an old personality.
183
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Most of the time, they magically survive this death and are literally or
symbolically reborn to reap the consequences of having cheated death.
They have passed the main test of being a hero.
Spielberg’s E.T. dies before our eyes but is reborn through alien
magic and a boy’s love. Sir Lancelot, remorseful over having killed a
gallant knight, prays him back to life. Clint Eastwood's character in
Unforgiven is beaten senseless by a sadistic sheriff and hovers at the edge
of death, thinking he’s seeing angels. Sherlock Holmes, apparently killed
with Professor Moriarity in the plunge over Reichenbach Falls, defies
death and returns transformed and ready for more adventures. Patrick
Swayze's character, murdered in Ghost, learns how to cross back through
the veil to protect his wife and finally express his true love for her.
CHANGE
Heroes don’t just visit death and come home. They return changed,
transformed. No one can go through an experience at the edge of
death without being changed in some way. In the center of An Officer
and a Gentleman, Richard Gere survives a death-and-rebirth ordeal
of the ego at the hands of drill instructor Lou Gossett. It dramatically
changes Gere’s character, making him more sensitive to the needs of
others and more conscious that he’s part of a group.
Axel Foley, with a villain’s gun to his head in Beverly Hills Cop,
seems sure to die, but is rescued by the bumbling, naive white detective Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). After this rescue from death, Foley is
more cooperative and willing to submerge his gigantic ego in the group.
THE CRISIS, NOT THE CLIMAX
The Ordeal is a major nerve ganglion of the story. Many threads of
the hero’ history lead in, and many threads of possibility and change
lead out the other side. It should not be confused with the climax of
the Hero's Journey — that’s another nerve center further down near
the end of the story (like the brain at the base of a dinosaur’s tail). The
184
THE ORDEAL
Ordeal is usually the central event of the story, or the main event of the
second act. Let’s call it the crisis to differentiate it from the climax (the
big moment of Act Three and the crowning event of the whole story).
A crisis is defined by Webster's as “the point in a story or drama
at which hostile forces are in the tensest state of opposition.” We also
speak of a crisis in an illness: a point, perhaps a high spike of fever,
after which the patient either gets worse or begins to recover. The message: Sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better.
An Ordeal crisis, however frightening to the hero, is sometimes the
only way to recovery or victory.
PLACEMENT OF THE ORDEAL
_ The placement of the crisis or Ordeal depends on the needs of the
story and the tastes of the storyteller. The most common pattern is for
the death-and-rebirth moment to come near the middle of the story,
as shown in the Central Crisis diagram.
CENTRAL CRISIS
ACT I ACT IIb ACT Il Denouement
Midpoint eT
Dramatic high points in a story with a Central Crisis
(vertical lines represent the high point of each act)
185
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
A central crisis has the advantage of symmetry, and leaves plenty of
time for elaborate consequences to flow from the ordeal. Note that
this structure allows for another critical moment or turning point at
the end of Act Two.
DELAYED CRISIS
Denouement
(no central ordeal; instead a long build-up to end of Act IT)
Dramatic high points in a story with a Delayed Crisis
However, an equally effective structure can be built with a delayed
crisis that comes near the end of Act Two, about two-thirds to threequarters of the way into the story.
The delayed-crisis structure matches closely with the ideal of the
Golden Mean, that elegant proportion (approximately three to five)
that seems to produce the most pleasing artistic results. A delayed crisis leaves more room for preparation and Approach and allows a slow
build-up to a big moment at the end of Act Two.
Whether the crisis is at the center of the story or nearer the end
of Act Two, it’s safe to say every story needs a crisis moment that conveys the Ordeal’s sense of death and revival.
186
THE ORDEAL
POINTS OF TENSION
Act Two is a long stretch for the writer and the audience, up to an
hour in an average feature film. You can look at the three-act structure as a dramatic line stretched across two major points of tension,
the act breaks. Like a circus tent hanging on its poles, structure is
subject to gravity — the waning of the audience’s attention in the
time between these peaks of tension. A story that has no central
moment of tension may sag like a circus tent that needs an extra
support pole in the middle. Act Two is an hour-long chunk of your
movie, or a hundred pages of your novel. It needs some kind of
structure to hold it in tension.
The crisis at the halfway point is a watershed, a continental divide
in the hero’s journey, that acknowledges the traveler has reached the
middle of the trip. Journeys naturally arrange themselves around a
central event: getting to the top of the mountain, the depth of the
cave, the heart of the forest, the most intimate interior of a foreign
country, or the most secret place in your own soul. Everything in the
trip has been leading up to this moment, and everything after it will
be just going home. There may be even greater adventures to come
— the final moments of a trip may be the most exciting or memorable — but every journey seems to have a center: a bottom or a peak,
somewhere near the middle.
The words crisis, critic, and critical come from a Greek word that
means “to separate.” A crisis is an event that separates the two halves
of the story. After crossing this zone, which is often the borderland
of death, the hero is literally or metaphorically reborn and nothing
will ever be the same.
WITNESS TO SACRIFICE
The reality of a death-and-rebirth crisis may depend upon point
of view. A witness is often an important part of this stage, someone standing nearby who sees the hero appear to die, momentarily
187
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
mourns the death, and is elated when the hero is revived. Some of
the death-and-resurrection effects in Star Wars depend on the presence of witnesses, such as the two robot Allies, R2D2 and C3PO.
In an elaborate Supreme Ordeal sequence, they are listening by
intercom to the progress of their heroes, Skywalker and company.
The robots are horrified to hear what sounds like the heroes being
crushed to death in a giant trash-masher deep in the Inmost Cave
of the Death Star.
These witnesses stand for the audience, who are identifying
with the heroes and feeling the pain of death with them. It’s not
that audiences are sadistic and enjoy seeing their heroes killed. It’s
that we all relish a little taste of death every now and then. Its bitter flavor makes life taste sweeter. Anyone who has survived a true
near-death experience, a sudden close call in a car or plane, knows
that for a while afterward colors seem sharper, family and friends are
more important, and time is more precious. The nearness of death
makes life more real.
A TASTE OF DEATH
People pay good money for a taste of death. Bungee-jumping, skydiving, and terrifying amusement park rides give people the jolt that
awakens fuller appreciation of life. Adventure films and stories are
always popular because they offer a less risky way to experience death
and rebirth, through heroes we can identify with.
But wait a minute, we left poor Luke Skywalker being crushed to
death in the heart, or rather the stomach, of the Death Star. He’s in the
belly of the whale. The robot witnesses are distraught at hearing what
sounds like their master’s death. They grieve and the audience grieves
with them, tasting death. All of the filmmaker’s artful technique is
dedicated to making the audience think their heroes are being ground
to a paste. But then the robots realize that what they thought were
screams of death were in fact cries of relief and triumph. The robots
188
THE ORDEAL
I have a bad feeling about this.
managed to shut off the trash-masher and the heroes have miraculously survived. The grief of the robots and of the audience suddenly,
explosively, turns to joy.
THE ELASTICITY OF EMOTION
Human emotions, it seems, have certain elastic properties, rather like
basketballs. When thrown down hard, they bounce back high. In any
story you are trying to lift the audience, raise their awareness, heighten
their emotions. The structure of a story acts like a pump to increase
the involvement of the audience. Good structure works by alternately
lowering and raising the hero’s fortunes and, with them, the audience’s
emotions. Depressing an audience’s emotions has the same effect as
holding an inflated basketball under water: When the downward pressure is released, the ball flies up out of the water. Emotions depressed
by the presence of death can rebound in an instant to a higher state
than ever before. This can become the base on which you build to a
still higher level. The Ordeal is one of the deepest “depressions” in a
story and therefore leads to one of its highest peaks.
189
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
In an amusement park ride you are hurled around in darkness or
on the edge of space until you think you're going to die, but somehow
you come out elated that you have survived. A story without some hint
of this experience is missing its heart. Screenwriters sometimes have a
lot of trouble with the length of Act Two. It can seem monotonous,
episodic, or aimless. This may be because they’ve conceived of it as simply a series of obstacles to the hero’s final goal, rather than as a dynamic
series of events leading up to and trailing away from a central moment
of death and rebirth. Even in the silliest comedy or most light-hearted
romance, Act Two needs a central life-or-death crisis, a moment when
the hero is experiencing death or maximum danger to the enterprise.
HERO APPEARS TO DIE
The long second act of Star Wars is kept from sagging by a central crisis section in which the borders of death are thoroughly explored in
not one, but a series of ordeals. At another point in the giant trash
compactor sequence, Luke is pulled under the sewage by the tentacle
of an unseen monster. It was this scene that really made me understand the mechanism of the Ordeal.
First, the audience and the witnesses at hand (Han Solo, Princess
Leia, the Wookiee) see a few bubbles come up, a sign that Luke is still
struggling, alive, and breathing. So far, so good. But then the bubbles
stop coming. The witnesses begin reacting as if he were dead. In a few
seconds you begin to wonder if he’s ever coming up. You know George
Lucas is not going to kill off his hero halfway through the film and yet
you begin to entertain the possibility.
I remember seeing a preview screening of Star Wars on the Fox
lot and being completely taken in by the critical few seconds of this
scene. I had invested something of myself in Luke Skywalker and when
he appeared to be dead, I instantly became a disembodied presence in
the screen. I began flitting from surviving character to character, wondering who I could identify with next. Would I ride through the rest
190
THE ORDEAL
of the story as the spoiled Princess Leia, the selfish opportunist Han
Solo, or the beastly Wookiee? I didn’t feel comfortable in any of their
skins. In these few seconds I experienced something like panic. The
hero, for me, was truly in the belly of the whale, inaccessible, effectively dead. With the hero dead, who was I in this movie? What was
my point of view? My emotions, like the basketball held under water,
were depressed.
Just then Luke Skywalker explodes to the surface, slimy but alive.
He has died to our eyes, but now he lives again, rebirthed by the companions who help him to his feet. At once the audience feels elated. The
emotions ride higher for having been brought down so far. Experiences
like this are the key to the popularity of the Star Wars movies. They
fling heroes and audiences over the brink of death and snatch them
back repeatedly. It’s more than great special effects, funny dialogue, and
sex that people are paying for. They love to see heroes cheat death. In
fact they love to cheat death themselves. Identifying with a hero who
bounces back from death is bungee-jumping in dramatic form.
HERO WITNESSES DEATH
Star Wars has not given us enough of a taste of death yet. Before
the Ordeal section is over, Luke witnesses the physical death of his
Mentor, Obi Wan, in a laser duel with the villain Darth Vader. Luke
is devastated and feels the death as keenly as if it were his own.
But in this mythical world, the borders of life and death are deliberately fuzzy. Obi Wan’s body vanishes, raising the possibility he
may survive somewhere to return when needed, like King Arthur
and Merlin.
To a shaman like Obi Wan, death is a familiar threshold that can
be crossed back and forth with relative ease. Obi Wan lives within
Luke and the audience through his teachings. Despite physical death
he is able to give Luke crucial advice at later points in the story: “Trust
the Force, Luke.”
191
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
HERO CAUSES DEATH
The hero doesn’t have to die for the moment of death to have its
effect. The hero may be a witness to death or the cause of death.
In Body Heat the central event, William Hurt’s Ordeal, is murdering Kathleen Turner’s husband and disposing of his body. But it’s a
death for Hurt too, deep in his soul. His innocence has died, a victim of his own lust.
FACING THE SHADOW
By far the most common kind of Ordeal is some sort of battle or
confrontation with an opposing force. It could be a deadly enemy
villain, antagonist, opponent, or even a force of nature. An idea that
comes close to encompassing all these possibilities is the archetype of
the Shadow. A villain may be an external character, but in a deeper
sense what all these words stand for is the negative possibilities of
the hero himself. In other words, the hero’s greatest opponent is his
own Shadow.
As with all the archetypes, there are negative and positive manifestations of the Shadow. A dark side is needed sometimes to polarize
a hero or a system, to give the hero some resistance to push against.
Resistance can be your greatest source of strength. Ironically, what
seem to be villains fighting for our death may turn out to be forces
ultimately working for our good.
DEMONIZATION
Generally the Shadow represents the hero’s fears and unlikeable,
rejected qualities: all the things we don’t like about ourselves and
try to project onto other people. This form of projection is called
demonizing. People in emotional crisis will sometimes project all
their problems in a certain area onto another person or group who
become the symbol of everything they hate and fear in themselves. In
war and propaganda, the enemy becomes an inhuman devil, the dark
192
THE ORDEAL
Shadow of the righteous, angelic image we are trying to maintain for
ourselves. The Devil himself is God’s Shadow, a projection of all the
negative and rejected potential of the Supreme Being.
Sometimes we need this projection and polarization in order
to see an issue clearly. A system can stay in unhealthy imbalance for
a long time if the conflicts are not categorized, polarized, and made
to duke it out in some kind of dramatic confrontation. Usually the
Shadow can be brought out into the light. The unrecognized or
rejected parts are acknowledged and made conscious despite all their
struggling to remain in darkness. Dracula’s abhorrence of sunlight is
a symbol of the Shadow’s desire to remain unexplored.
Villains can be looked at as the hero’s Shadow in human form.
No matter how alien the villain’s values, in some way they are the dark
reflection of the hero’s own desires, magnified and distorted, her greatest fears come to life.
DEATH OF A VILLAIN
Sometimes the hero comes close to death at the Ordeal, but it is the
villain who dies. However, the hero may have other forces, other
Shadows, to deal with before the adventure is over. The action
may move from the physical arena to a moral, spiritual, or emotional plane. Dorothy kills the Wicked Witch in Act Two, but faces
an ordeal of the spirit: the death of her hopes of getting home in
Act Three,
A villain’s death should not be too easy for the hero to accomplish. In an Ordeal scene in Hitchcock’s Torn Curtain, the hero tries
to kill a spy in a farmhouse with no real weapons at hand. Hitchcock
makes the point that killing someone can be much harder than the
movies usually make it seem. Anyone’s death has an emotional cost,
as well, as the movie Unforgiven repeatedly shows. Clint Eastwood's
bounty hunter kills but is painfully aware his targets are men just like
him. Death should be real, and not a mere plot convenience.
193
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
THE VILLAIN ESCAPES
The hero may wound the villain at the Ordeal or kill the villain’s
underling. The chief villain escapes to be confronted once again in
Act Three. Axel Foley has a death-and-rebirth confrontation with
the criminal mastermind’s lieutenants in Act Two of Beverly Hills
Cop, but the final showdown with the main Shadow is held back
for Act Three.
VILLAINS ARE HEROES OF THEIR OWN STORIES
Keep in mind that while some villains or Shadows exult in being
bad, many don’t think of themselves as evil at all. In their own minds
they are right, the heroes of their own stories. A dark moment for the
hero is a bright one for a Shadow. The arcs of their stories are mirror images: When the hero is up, the villain is down. It depends on
point of view. By the time you are done writing a screenplay or novel,
you should know your characters well enough that you can tell the
story from the point of view of everyone: heroes, villains, sidekicks,
lovers, allies, guardians, and lesser folk. Each is the hero of his own
story. It’s a good exercise to walk through the story at least once in
the Shadow’s skin.
HOW HEROES CHEAT DEATH
In the classic hero myths the Ordeal is set up as a moment in which
the hero is expected to die. Many have come to this point before
and none have survived. Perseus’ Approach to the monster Medusa
is choked with statues of heroes turned to stone by her glance. The
labyrinth which Theseus enters is littered with the bones of those
who were eaten by the monster inside or who starved trying to find
their way out.
These mythic heroes face certain death but survive where others
have failed because they have wisely sought supernatural aid in the
earlier stages. They cheat death, usually with the help of the Mentor’s
194
THE ORDEAL
gifts. Perseus uses the magic mirror, Athena’s gift, to approach Medusa
and avoid her direct gaze. He cuts off her head with his magic sword
and keeps it from doing further harm by stowing it in his magic
pouch, another Mentor’s gift.
In the story of Theseus, the hero has won the love of Ariadne,
daughter of the tyrant Minos of Crete, in the Approach phase. Now,
when Theseus must go into the uncertain, deadly depths of the Labyrinth, he turns to Ariadne for aid. The princess goes to the Mentor of
the story, the great inventor and architect Daedalus, designer of the
Labyrinth. His magical help is of the simplest kind: a ball of thread.
Ariadne holds one end while Theseus winds through the Labyrinth.
He is able to find his way back from the house of death because of
his connection to her — because of love, the thread that binds them.
ARIADNE’S THREAD
Ariadne’s Thread is a potent symbol of the power of love, of the
almost telepathic wiring that joins people in an intense relationship.
It can tug at you like a physical connector at times. It’s close kin to
the “apron strings” that bind even adult children to their mothers —
invisible wires but with greater tensile strength than steel.
Ariadne’s Thread is an elastic band that connects a hero with
loved ones. A hero may venture far out into madness or death, but is
usually pulled back by such bonds. My mother tells me she had a medical emergency when I was a child that almost killed her. Her spirit left
her body and flew around the room, feeling free and ready to leave,
and only the sight of my sisters and me snapped her back into life. She
had a reason to go on living, to take care of us.
The Old English word for a ball of thread is a “clew.’ That’s where
we get our word clue. A clue is a thread that a seeker traces back to
a center, looking for answers or order. The skeins of thread that connect one heart to another may be the vital clue that solves a mystery
or resolves a conflict.

CRISIS OF THE HEART
The Ordeal can be a crisis of the heart. In a story of romance it might
be the moment of greatest intimacy, something we all desire and yet
fear. Perhaps what’s dying here is a hero’s defensiveness. In another
story it might be a dark moment in the romance when the hero experiences betrayal or the apparent death of the relationship.
Joseph Campbell describes what we might call the romantic
branches of the Ordeal in two chapters of The Hero With a Thousand
Faces called “Meeting with the Goddess” and “Woman as Temptress.” As he says, “the ultimate adventure . . . is commonly represented
as a mystical marriage ... the crisis at the nadir, the zenith, or at the
uttermost edge of the earth, at the central point of the cosmos, in the
cosmos, in the tabernacle of the temple, or within the darkness of
the deepest chamber of the heart.” In stories of love, the crisis may be
either a love scene or a separation from a loved one. Crisis, remember,
comes from a Greek word meaning “to separate.”
In Romancing the Stone the crisis is both a physical Ordeal and a
separation of loved ones. Joan Wilder and her shapeshifting companion Jack Colton enter a literal Inmost Cave where they take possession
of the giant emerald, E/ Corazon. But that’s much too easy and a few
moments later they go through a real Supreme Ordeal as their car
plunges over a waterfall and they dive out. Joan Wilder disappears
under the water for several shots. The audience sees Jack Colton struggle ashore, and for scant seconds we are left wondering if Joan has
died. Those few seconds are sufficient for the magic of the Supreme
Ordeal to work. Joan then appears, struggling onto a rock in the foreground. That she has died and been reborn is clearly acknowledged in
the dialogue. On the opposite bank, Colton cries out, “I thought you
drowned.” Joan acknowledges, “I did.”
Colton is elated by their physical survival, but now the focus of
the crisis for Joan shifts to the emotional plane. The untrustworthy
Colton is on the opposite side of the raging river with the jewel. A
196
THE ORDEAL
real test of their love is coming. Will he keep his promise to meet her
in the next town, or will he simply run away with El Corazon and
break her heart? Will she be able to survive in the jungle of the Special World without him?
SACRED MARRIAGE
In stories with emotional and psychological depth, the Ordeal may
bring a moment of mystic marriage within a person, a balancing of
opposing inner forces. The fear and death aspect of the Ordeal may
haunt the wedding: What if this doesn’t work out? What if the part of
myself I am walking to the altar with turns and overwhelms me? But
despite these fears, heroes may acknowledge their hidden qualities,
even their Shadows, and join with them in a sacred marriage. Heroes
are ultimately seeking a confrontation with their anima, their soul,
or the unrecognized feminine or intuitive parts of their personality.
Women may be seeking the animus, the masculine powers of
reason and assertion that society has told them to hide. They may be
trying to get back in touch with a creative drive or a maternal energy
they've rejected. In a moment of crisis, a hero may get in touch with
all sides of her personality as her many selves are called forth en masse
to deal with her life-and-death issues.
BALANCE
In a Sacred Marriage both sides of the personality are acknowledged
to be of equal value. Such a hero, in touch with all the tools of being
a human, is in a state of balance, centered, and not easily dislodged or
upset. Campbell says the Sacred Marriage “represents the hero’s total
mastery of life,” a balanced marriage between the hero and life itself.
Therefore the Ordeal may be a crisis in which the hero is joined
with the repressed feminine or masculine side in a Sacred Marriage.
But there may also be a Sacred Breakup! Open, deadly war may be
declared by the dueling male and female sides.
197
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
THE LOVE THAT KILLS
Campbell touches on this destructive conflict in “The Woman as
Temptress.” The title is perhaps misleading — as with “The Meeting with the Goddess,” the energy of this moment could be male
or female. This Ordeal possibility takes the hero to a junction of
betrayal, abandonment, or disappointment. It’s a crisis of faith in the
arena of love.
Every archetype has both a bright, positive side and a dark, negative side. The dark side of love is the mask of hate, recrimination,
outrage, and rejection. This is the face of Medea as she kills her own
children, the mask of Medusa herself, ringed with poison snakes of
blame and guilt.
A crisis may come when a shapeshifting lover suddenly shows
another side, leaving the hero feeling bitterly betrayed and dead to the
idea of love. This is a favorite Hitchcock device. After a tender love
scene in North by Northwest, Cary Grant’s character is betrayed to the
spies by Eva Marie Saint. Grant goes into his mid-movie Ordeal feeling abandoned by her. The possibility of true love that she represented
now seems dead, and it makes his Ordeal, in which he’s almost gunned
down by a crop-dusting plane in a cornfield, all the more lonely.
NEGATIVE ANIMUS OR ANIMA
Sometimes in the journey of our lives we confront negative projections
of the anima or animus. This can be a person who attracts us but isn’t
good for us, or a bitchy or bastardly part of ourselves that suddenly
asserts itself like Mr. Hyde taking over from Dr. Jekyll. Such a confrontation can be a life-threatening Ordeal in a relationship or in a person’s
development. The hero of Fatal Attraction finds that a casual lover can
turn into a lethal force if crossed or rejected. An ideal partner can turn
into the Boston Strangler or a loving father can become a killer as in
The Shining. The wicked stepmothers and queens of the Grimms’ fairy
tales were, in the original versions, mothers whose love turned deadly.
198
THE ORDEAL
GOING PSYCHO
One of the most disturbing and subversive uses of the Supreme Ordeal
isin Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. The audience is made to identify and
sympathize with Marion (Janet Leigh), even though she is an embezzler on the run. Through the first half of Act Two, there is no one else
to identify with except the drippy innkeeper, Norman Bates (Anthony
Perkins), and no audience wants to identify with him — he’s weird.
In a conventional film, the hero always survives the Ordeal and lives
to see the villain defeated in the climax. It’s unimaginable that a star
like Janet Leigh, an immortal heroine of the screen, will be sacrificed
at the midpoint. But Hitchcock does the unthinkable and kills our
hero halfway through the story. This is one Ordeal that is final for the
hero. No reprieve, no resurrection, no curtain call for Marion.
The effect is shattering. You get that odd feeling of being a disembodied ghost, floating around the frame as you watch Marion’s
blood pour down the drain. Who to identify with? Who to be? Soon
it’s clear: Hitchcock is giving you no one to identify with but Norman. Reluctantly we enter Norman’s mind, see the story through his
eyes, and even begin to root for him as cur new hero. At first we’re
supposed to think Norman is covering up for his insane mother, but
later we discover Norman himself was the killer. We have been walking around in the skin of a psycho. Only a master like Hitchcock can
pull off such a defiance of the rules about heroes, death, and Ordeals.
FACING THE GREATEST FEAR
The Ordeal can be defined as the moment the hero faces his greatest
fear. For most people this is death, but in many stories it’s just whatever the hero is most afraid of: facing up to a phobia, challenging a
rival, or roughing out a storm or a political crisis. Indiana Jones inevitably must come face-to-face with what he fears most — snakes.
Of the many fears faced by heroes, the greatest dramatic power
seems to come from the fear of standing up to a parent or authority
199
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
figure. The family scene is the core of most serious drama, and a confrontation with a parent figure can provide a strong Ordeal.
STANDING UP TO A PARENT
In Red River Montgomery Clift’s character, Matthew Garth, faces
this fear halfway through the story when he tries to take away control
of a cattle drive from his foster-father, Tom Dunson (John Wayne),
who has become a formidable Shadow. Dunson started the story as
hero and Mentor, but traded those masks for that of a tyrant in the
Approach phase. He’s turned into a demented god, wounded, drunk,
and cruel: an abusive father to his men, carrying duty too far. When
Matt challenges his Mentor and role model, he is facing his greatest
fear in an Ordeal.
Dunson decrees he will play god and hang men who broke the
laws of his little world. Matt stands up to him at the risk of being shot
himself. Dunson, the Lord Death rising from his throne, draws to kill
him; but Matt’s Allies, earned in the Testing phase, step in and blow
the gun out of Dunson’s hand. Matt’s power as a hero is now such that
he doesn’t need to lift a finger against his opponent. His will alone
is strong enough to defeat death. In effect he dethrones Dunson and
becomes king of the cattle drive himself, leaving his foster-father with
nothing but a horse and a canteen. In stories like this, facing the greatest fear is depicted as youth standing up to the older generation.
YOUTH VERSUS AGE
The challenging of the older generation by the younger is a timeless
drama, and the Supreme Ordeal of standing up to a forbidding parent
is as old as Adam and Eve, Oedipus, or King Lear. This ageless conflict provides much of the power of playwriting. The play On Golden
Pond deals with a daughter’s frantic effort to please her father, and
its Ordeals are the daughter standing up to the father, and the father
experiencing his own mortality.
200
THE ORDEAL
This generational drama is sometimes played out on a world
stage. The Chinese dissident students who took over Tiananmen
Square and blocked the tanks with their bodies were challenging the
status quo imposed by their parents and grandparents.
Fairy-tale struggles with wolves and witches may be ways of
expressing conflicts with parents. The witches are the dark aspect of
the mother; the wolves, ogres, or giants the dark aspect of the father.
Dragons and other monsters can be the Shadow side of a parent or a
generation that has held on too long. Campbell spoke of the dragon
as a Western symbol of a tyrant who has held fast to a kingdom or a
family until all the life has been squeezed out of it.
The conflict between youth and age can be expressed internally
as well as in external battles between children and parents. The smoldering combat that ignites in the Ordeal may be an inner struggle
between an old, comfortable, well-defended personality structure and
a new one that is weak, unformed, but eager to be born. But the new
Self can’t be born until the old one dies or at least steps aside to leave
more room on the center stage.
In rare cases an Ordeal can be the occasion for a healing of deep
wounds between a hero and a parent. Campbell calls this possibility “Atonement with the Father.” Sometimes a hero, by surviving an
Ordeal or by daring to challenge the authority of a parental figure,
will win the parent’s approval and the seeming conflicts between them
will be resolved.
DEATH OF THE EGO
The Ordeal in myths signifies the death of the ego. The hero is now fully
part of the cosmos, dead to the old, limited vision of things and reborn
into a new consciousness of connections. The old boundaries of the
Self have been transcended or annihilated. In some sense the hero has
become a god with the divine ability to soar above the normal limits of
death and see the broader view of the connectedness of all things. The
201
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Greeks called this a moment of apotheosis, a step up from enthusiasm
where you merely have the god in you. In a state of apotheosis you are
the god. Tasting death lets you sit in God’s chair for a while.
The hero facing an Ordeal has moved her center from the ego to
the Self, to the more godlike part of her. There may also be a movement from Self to group as a hero accepts more responsibility than
just looking out for herself. A hero risks individual life for the sake of
the larger collective life and wins the right to be called “hero.”
THE WIZARD OF OZ
Dorothy and friends, trapped by the Wicked Witch and her Threshold
Guardian army, now face their Supreme Ordeal. The Witch is enraged
at them for having penetrated her Inmost Cave and stolen her greatest
treasure, the Ruby Slippers. She descends on the foursome and threatens
to kill them one by one, saving Dorothy until last.
The threat of death makes the stakes of the scene clear. The audience now
knows its going to be a battle between forces of life and death.
The Witch begins with the Scarecrow. She lights her broomstick and uses
it as a torch to set him on fire. His straw blazes up and it looks like all is
lost. Every child in the audience believes the Scarecrow is doomed and feels
the horror of death with him.
Dorothy operates on instinct and does the only thing she can think of to
save her friend: She grabs up a bucket of water and splashes it all over the
Scarecrow. It puts out the fire, but it also wets down the Witch. Dorothy
had no intention of killing the Witch, didn’t even realize water would
make her melt, but has killed her just the same. Death was in the room,
and Dorothy merely deflected it onto another victim.
But the Witch does not just go “poof” and disappear. Her death is protracted, agonizing, and pathetic. “Oh, my beautiful wickedness! What a
world, what a world!” By the time it’s over you feel sorry for the Witch,
and have had a real taste of death.

STAGE NINE:
REWARD
oe
“We came, we saw, we kicked its ass.”
— from Ghostbusters, screenplay by
Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis
ith the crisis of the Ordeal passed, heroes now
experience the consequences of surviving death.
With the dragon that dwelt in the Inmost Cave
slain or vanquished, they seize the sword of victory and lay claim to their Reward. Triumph
may be fleeting but for now they savor its pleasures.
Encountering death is a big event and it will surely have consequences. There will almost always be some period of time in which the
hero is recognized or rewarded for having survived death or a great
ordeal. A great many possibilities are generated by living through a crisis,
and Reward, the aftermath of the Ordeal, has many shapes and purposes.
CELEBRATION
When hunters have survived death and brought down their game, it’s
natural to want to celebrate. Energy has been exhausted in the struggle, and needs to be replenished. Heroes may have the equivalent of a
205
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
party or barbecue at this stage in which they cook and consume some
of the fruits of victory. The heroes of The Odyssey always offered a sacrifice and had a meal to give thanks and celebrate after surviving some
ordeal at sea. Strength is needed for the return to the upper world, so
time is given for rest, recuperation, and refueling. After the buffalo hunt
(a Supreme Ordeal and brush with death) in Dances With Wolves, Dunbar and the tribe celebrate with a buffalo barbecue in which his Reward
for saving a young man from death is greater acceptance by the Lakota.
CAMPFIRE SCENES
Many stories seem to have campfire-type scenes in this region, where the
hero and companions gather around a fire or its equivalent to review the
recent events. It’s also an opportunity for jokes and boasting. There is
understandable relief at having survived death. Hunters and fishermen,
pilots and navigators, soldiers and explorers all like to exaggerate their
accomplishments. At the barbecue in Dances With Wolves, Dunbar is
forced to retell the story of the buffalo hunt many times.
There may be conflict over the campfire, fighting over spoils.
Dunbar gets into an argument over his hat, which has been picked up
by a Sioux warrior after Dunbar dropped it during the buffalo hunt.
A campfire scene may also be a chance for reminiscence or nostalgia. Having crossed the abyss of life and death, nothing will ever be the
same. Heroes sometimes turn back and remember aloud what got them
to this point. A loner hero might recall the events or people who influenced him, or speak about the unwritten code by which he runs his life.
These scenes serve important functions for the audience. They
allow us to catch our breath after an exciting battle or ordeal. The
characters might recap the story so far, giving us a chance to review
the story and get a glimpse of how they perceive it. In Red River, Matthew Garth reviews the plot for a newcomer to the story, Tess (Joanne
Dru), in a campfire scene. He reveals his feelings about his fosterfather and gives the audience a perspective on the complex, epic story.
206
REWARD
If there are no actual campfires crackling and flickering while the
hero reflects on the lessons of the Ordeal, it is remarkable how often
moviemakers instinctively turn to other sources of illumination at
this point in a story. Sometimes it takes the form of a candlelit dinner or an intimate scene near a blazing fireplace, or it may be a fleeting
glimpse of flame when cigarettes are lit by matches or lighters. Perhaps
the open flame is an intuitive expression of the dawning of enlightenment in the characters.
A related phenomenon, astutely observed by my colleague, novelist and writing teacher James Scott Bell, is the persistence of “mirror
moments’ in movies during this passage, between some major setback
for the hero and the final resolution of the story. Bell points out that
many films, such as The Fugitive, depict the hero confronting his or
her own image in a mirror, considering how the ordeal has changed
him or her, probably thinking something like “What have I become?”
Such a scene sometimes marks a turning point from which the hero
will pivot with a renewed determination to succeed or at least carry
on despite doubts and self-judgments. It is said that mirrors don’t lie
and “taking a good look in the mirror” means honestly examining
your behavior, character, and responsibilities so you can advance to
the next stage in life without illusions.
In these quiet moments of reflection or intimacy we get to know
the characters better. A memorable example is the scene in Jaws in
which Robert Shaw’s character, Quint, tells about his horrible World
War II experiences with sharks in the Pacific. The men compare scars
and sing a drinking song. It’s a “getting-to-know-you” scene, built on
the intimacy that comes from having survived an Ordeal together.
In Walt Disney’s classic animated features such as Pinocchio or
Peter Pan, the pace is usually frantic, but Disney was careful to slow
them down from time to time and get in close on the characters in an
emotional moment. These quieter or more lyric Passages are important for making a connection with the audience.
207
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
LOVE SCENES
The aftermath of a Supreme Ordeal may be an opportunity for a love
scene. Heroes don’t really become heroes until the crisis; until then
they are just trainees. They don’t really deserve to be loved until they
have shown their willingness to sacrifice. At this point a true hero has
earned a love scene, or a “sacred marriage” of some kind. The Red River
campfire scene described above is also a highly effective love scene.
In the thriller Arabesque, Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren, having survived an Ordeal together, are bonded in a love scene. She is a
bewildering Shapeshifter who has told him a string of lies, but he has
seen through to her essential core of goodness, and now trusts her.
The romantic waltz in Beauty and the Beast is the Beast’s Reward
for having survived an Ordeal with the townspeople and Belle’s
Reward for having seen past the Beast’s monstrous appearance.
TAKING POSSESSION
One of the essential aspects of this step is the hero taking possession
of whatever she came seeking. Treasure hunters take the gold, spies
snatch the secret, pirates plunder the captured ship, an uncertain hero
seizes her self-respect, a slave seizes control of his own destiny. A transaction has been made — the hero has risked death or sacrificed life,
and now gets something in exchange. The Norse god Odin, in his
Supreme Ordeal, gives up an eye and hangs on the World-Tree for
nine days and nights. His Reward is the knowledge of all things and
the ability to read the sacred runes.
SEIZING THE SWORD
I also call this unit of the journey Seizing the Sword because often it’s
an active movement of the hero who aggressively takes possession of
whatever was being sought in the Special World. Sometimes a reward
like love is given. But more frequently the hero takes possession of a
208
REWARD
treasure or even steals it, like James Bond taking the Lektor, a Soviet
translating device, in From Russia with Love.
A moment of taking possession follows the death-and-rebirth
crisis in King Kong. A transformation had occurred in the monster
ape during the Approach phase. King Kong shifted from being Fay
Wray’s abductor to being her protector, fighting off a tyrannosaur
on the way to his Inmost Cave. By the time he reaches the Supreme
Ordeal, defending her in a battle to the death with a giant serpent,
he has become a full-fledged hero. Now he takes possession of his
Reward. Like any good hero, he gets the girl.
In a tender but erotic scene, he takes her out onto the “balcony”
of his cave and examines her, cradled in his enormous palm. He pulls
off her clothes, strip by strip, sniffing her perfume curiously. He tickles
her with his finger. The love scene is interrupted by another dinosaur
threat, but it was definitely a Reward moment, a payback for having
faced death head-on during the crisis.
The idea of a hero Seizing the Sword comes from memories of
stories in which heroes battle dragons and take their treasure. Among
the treasures there may be a magic sword, perhaps the sword of the
hero’s father, broken or stolen by the dragon in previous battles. The
image of the sword, as portrayed in the Tarot deck’s suit of swords,
is a symbol of the hero’s will, forged in fire and quenched in blood,
broken and remade, hammered and folded, hardened, sharpened, and
focused to a point like the lightsabers of Star Wars.
But a sword is only one of many images for what is being seized
by the hero at this step. Campbell’s term for it is “The Ultimate Boon.”
Another concept is the Holy Grail, an ancient and mysterious symbol for all the unattainable things of the soul that knights and heroes
quest after. A rose or a jewel may be the treasure in another story. The
wily Monkey King of Chinese legends is seeking the sacred Buddhist
sutras that have been taken to Tibet.
209
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
ELIXIR THEFT
Some heroes purchase the treasure in effect, buying it with their lives or
the willingness to risk life. But other heroes steal the magic thing at the
heart of the story. The prize is not always given, even if it has been paid
for or earned. It must be taken. Campbell calls this motif “elixir theft.”
Elixir means a medium or vehicle for medicine. It could be a
harmless sweet liquid or powder to which other medicine is added.
Administered alone or mixed with other useless chemicals, it might
still work by what’s known as the “placebo effect.” Studies have shown
that some people get better on a placebo, a substance with no medicinal value, even when they know it’s just a sugar pill — testimony to
the power of suggestion.
An elixir can also be a medicine that heals every ill, a magical
substance that restores life. In alchemy the elixir is one of the steps
towards the philosopher’s stone which can transmute metals, create
life, and transcend death. This ability to overcome the forces of death
is the real Elixir most heroes seek.
The hero is often required to steal the Elixir. It is the secret of life
and death, and much too valuable to be given up lightly. Heroes may
turn Trickster or thief to make off with the treasure, like Prometheus
stealing fire from the gods for mankind, or Adam and Eve tasting the
apple. This theft may intoxicate the hero for a time, but there is often
a heavy price to pay later.
INITIATION
Heroes emerge from their Ordeals to be recognized as special and
different, part of a select few who have outwitted death. The Immortals of ancient Greece were a very exclusive club. Only the gods and a
smattering of lucky humans were exempt from death, and only those
humans who had done something remarkable or pleasing to the gods
would be granted admittance by Zeus. Among these were Hercules,
Andromeda, and Aesculapius.
210
REWARD
Battlefield promotions and knighthood are ways of recognizing that
heroes have passed an ordeal and entered a smaller group of special survivors. Joseph Campbell's overall name for what we are calling Act Two is
“Initiation,” a new beginning in a new rank. The hero after facing death
is really a new creature. A woman who has gone through the life-threatening territory of childbirth belongs to a different order of being. She
has been initiated into the company of motherhood, a select sorority.
Initiation into secret societies, sororities, or fraternities means
that you are privy to certain secrets and sworn never to reveal them.
You pass tests to prove your worthiness. You may be put through a
ritual death-and-rebirth Ordeal and may be given a new name and
rank to signify you are a newborn being.
NEW PERCEPTIONS
Heroes may find that surviving death grants new powers or better perceptions. In the previous chapter we spoke of death’s ability to sharpen
the perception of life. This is beautifully captured in the northern
tale of Sigurd the dragon-killer. Sigurd’s Supreme Ordeal is to slay a
dragon named Fafnir. A drop of the dragon’s blood happens to fall on
Sigurd’s tongue. He has truly tasted death, and for this is granted new
powers of perception. He can understand the language of the birds,
and hears two of them warning him that his Mentor, the dwarf Regin,
plans to kill him. He is saved from a second deadly danger because of
his newfound power, the Reward for surviving death. New knowledge
may be the sword that the hero seizes.
SEEING THROUGH DECEPTION
A hero may be granted a new insight or understanding of a mystery
as her Reward. She may see through a deception. If she has been dealing with a shapeshifting partner, she may see through his disguises.
and perceive the reality for the first time. Seizing the Sword can be a
moment of clarity.
211
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
CLAIRVOYANCE
After transcending death, a hero may even become clairvoyant or
telepathic, sharing in the power of the immortal gods. Clairvoyant
means simply “seeing clearly.” A hero who has faced death is more
aware of the connectedness of things, more intuitive. In Arabesque,
after the love scene between Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren, the
lovers are trying to figure out a secret code in ancient hieroglyphics. Peck suddenly realizes, with his newfound perceptive ability,
that what the spies are after is not the code but a microfilm dot on
the piece of paper. Surviving death has given him new power of
insight. The realization is so exciting that it propels the movie into
Act Three.
SELF-REALIZATION
Insight might be of a deeper type. Heroes can sometimes experience a profound self-realization after tricking death. They see who
they are and how they fit into the scheme of things. They see the
ways they’ve been foolish or stubborn. The scales fall from their
eyes and the illusion of their lives is replaced with clarity and truth.
Maybe it doesn’t last long, but for a moment heroes see themselves clearly.
EPIPHANY
Others may see the hero more clearly, too. Others may see in their
changed behavior signs that they have been reborn and share in
the immortality of gods. This is sometimes called a moment of
epiphany: an abrupt realization of divinity. The Feast of the Epiphany, observed in the Catholic Church on January 6, celebrates the
moment when the Magi, three Wise Old Men, first realized the
divinity of the newborn Christ. One of the Rewards of surviving
death is that others can see that heroes have changed. Young people
coming back from a war or from an ordeal like basic training seem
212
REWARD
different — more mature, self-confident, and serious, and worthy
of a little more respect. There is a chain of divine experience: from
enthusiasm, being visited by a god, to apotheosis, becoming a god,
to epiphany, being recognized as a god.
Heroes themselves may experience epiphany. A hero may realize suddenly, after a moment of Supreme Ordeal, that he is the son
of a god or a king, a chosen one with special powers. Epiphany is a
moment of realizing you are a divine and sacred being, connected to
all things.
James Joyce expanded the meaning of the word epiphany, using
it to mean a sudden perception of the essence of something, seeing
to the core of a person, idea, or thing. Heroes sometimes experience a sudden understanding of the nature of things after passing
through an Ordeal. Surviving death gives meaning to life and sharpens perceptions.
DISTORTIONS
In other stories the conquest of death may lead to some distortions of
perception. Heroes may suffer from an inflation of the ego. In other
words, they get a swelled head. They might turn cocky or arrogant.
Perhaps they abuse the power and privilege of being a reborn hero.
Their self-esteem sometimes grows too large and distorts their perception of their real value.
Heroes may be tainted by the very death or evil they came to
fight. Soldiers fighting to preserve civilization may fall into the barbarism of war. Cops or detectives battling criminals often cross the line
and use illegal or immoral means, becoming as bad as the criminals
themselves. Heroes can enter the mental world of their opponents and
get stuck there, like the detective in Manhunter who risks his soul to
enter the twisted mind of a serial killer.
Bloodshed and murder are powerful forces and may intoxicate or
poison a hero. Peter O’ Toole as Lawrence of Arabia shows us a man

who, after the Ordeal of the battle of Aqaba, is horrified to discover
that he loves killing.
Another error heroes may make at this point is simply to underestimate the significance of the Supreme Ordeal. Someone hit by the
hammer of change may deny that anything has happened. Denial
after an encounter with death is one of the natural stages of grief and
recovery described by Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. Anger is another.
Heroes may just let off some steam after the Ordeal, expressing justifiable resentment over having been made to face death.
Heroes may also overestimate their own importance or prowess
after a duel with death. But they may soon find out that they were just
lucky the first time, and will have other encounters with danger that
will teach them their limits.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
The immediate aftermath of the Ordeal in The Wizard of Oz is an act of
Seizing. Instead of a sword, it’s the burnt broomstick of the Wicked Witch
that Dorothy takes possession of. Actually, she’s much too well-mannered
to just grab it; she politely asks for it from the fearsome guards who have
now fallen to their knees to show their loyalty to her. Dorothy had good
reason to fear they would turn on her after the Witch's death. But in fact
the guards are glad the Witch is dead, for now they are free of her awful
slavery. Another Reward of surviving death is that Threshold Guardians may be completely won over to the hero's side. The guards give her
the broomstick gladly.
Dorothy and companions return swiftly to the Wizard’s throne room
where she lays the broom before the ferocious floating Head. She has
fulfilled her bargain with the Wizard, and completed the seemingly
impossible task. Now she and her friends claim their heroes’ Reward.
But to their surprise, the Wizard balks at paying up. He gets furious and
argumentative. He is like an old personality structure or a parent that
knows it must yield to a maturing offspring but is reluctant to let £0; putting up one last fight.
214
REWARD
It’s then that the little dog Toto fulfills his purpose in the story. His animal intuition and curiosity got Dorothy in trouble in the first place,
when he dug in Miss Gulch’s flower bed. Now they are the instrument
of salvation. As Toto noses around behind the throne, he discovers a
meek little old man behind a curtain, controlling the monstrous illusion of Oz, the great and powerful. This man, not the bellowing head,
is the real Wizard of Oz.
This is a typical post-ordeal realization or moment of insight. The heroes
see, through the eyes of the intuitive, curious Toto, that behind the illusion
of the mightiest organization is a human being with emotions that can be
reached. (This scene has always seemed to me a metaphor for Hollywood,
which tries very hard to be scary and awesome, but which is made up of
ordinary people with fears and flaws.)
At first the Wizard professes to be unable to help them, but with encouragement he provides Elixirs for Dorothy’ helpers: a diploma for the
Scarecrow, a medal of valor for the Lion, and a windup heart ‘for the Tin
Woodsman. There is a tone of satire about this scene. It seems to be saying:
These Elixirs are placebos, meaningless symbols that men give each other.
Many people with degrees, medals, or testimonials have done nothing to
earn them. Those who have not survived death can take the Elixir all day
long but it still won't help them.
The true all-healing Elixir is the achievement of inner change, but the
scene acknowledges that it’s important to get outward recognition as well.
As a surrogate parent for the lot of them, the Wizard is granting them the
ultimate boon of a father’s approval, a Reward that few people get. Heart,
brains, and courage are inside them and always were, but the physical
objects SEvVE AS A reminder.
Now the Wizard turns to Dorothy and says sadly there is nothing he
can do for her. He was blown to Oz in a balloon from the Nebraska
state fair, and has no idea how to get back home himself. He's right —
only Dorothy can grant herself the self-acceptance to “get home,’ that is,
be happy inside herself wherever she is. But he agrees to try and orders
a big hot-air balloon to be built by the citizens of Oz. The heroes have
seized everything except the elusive prize of Home, which must be sought
in Act Three.

Facing death has life-changing consequences which heroes experience
by Seizing the Sword, but after experiencing their Reward fully, heroes
must turn back to the quest. There are more Ordeals ahead, and it’s
time to pack up and face them, on the next stage of the Hero's Journey: The Road Back.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. What is the modern equivalent of a campfire scene in Black
Panther? The Incredibles? Life of Pi? Django Unchained?
2. What do the heroes of your stories learn by observing death? By |
causing death? By experiencing death?
3. What do the heroes of your story take possession of after facing death or their greatest fears? What is the aftermath, the
consequence, of the major event of Act Two? Have your heroes
absorbed any negative qualities from the Shadow or villain?
4. Does the story change direction? Is a new goal or agenda revealed
in the Reward phase?
5. Is the aftermath of the Ordeal in your story an opportunity for
a love scene?
6. Do your heroes realize they have changed? Is there self-examination or realization of wider consciousness? Have they learned to
deal with their inner flaws?

“Easy is the descent to the Lower World; but,
to retrace your steps and to escape to the upper
air — this is the task, this the toil.”
— The Sibyl to Aeneas in The Aeneid
nce the lessons and Rewards of the great Ordeal
have been celebrated and absorbed, heroes
face a choice: whether to remain in the Special World or begin the journey home to the
Ordinary World. Although the Special World
may have its charms, few heroes elect to stay. Most take The Road
Back, returning to the starting point or continuing on the journey to
a totally new locale or ultimate destination.
This is a time when the story’s energy, which may have ebbed a
little in the quiet moments of Seizing the Sword, is now revved up
again. If we look at the Hero’s Journey as a circle with the beginning at
the top, we are still down in the basement and it will take some push
to get us back up into the light.

In psychological terms this stage represents the resolve of the
hero to return to the Ordinary World and implement the lessons
learned in the Special World. This can be far from easy. The hero has
reason to fear that the wisdom and magic of the Ordeal may evaporate in the harsh light of common day. No one may believe the hero’s
miraculous escape from death. The adventures may be rationalized
away by skeptics. But most heroes determine to try. Like the Bodhisattvas of Buddhist belief, they have seen the eternal plan but return
to the world of the living to tell others about it and share the elixir
they have won.
220
THE ROAD BACK
MOTIVATION
The Road Back marks a time when heroes rededicate themselves to
the adventure. A plateau of comfort has been reached and heroes
must be pried off that plateau, either by their own inner resolve or by
an external force.
Inner resolve might be represented by a scene of a tired commander rallying dispirited troops after a battle, or a parent pulling a
family together after a death or tragedy. An external force might be
an alarm going off, a clock ticking, or a renewed threat by a villain.
The heroes may be reminded of the ultimate goal of the adventure.
The Road Back is a turning point, another threshold crossing
which marks the passage from Act Two to Act Three. Like crossing
the First Threshold, it may cause a change in the aim of the story. A
story about achieving some goal becomes a story of escape; a focus on
physical danger shifts to emotional risks. The propellant that boosts
the story out of the depths of the Special World may be a new development or piece of information that drastically redirects the story. In
effect, The Road Back causes the third act. It can be another moment
of crisis that sets the hero on a new and final road of trials.
The rocket fuel may be fear of retaliation or pursuit. Often heroes
are motivated to hit The Road Back when the forces they have defied
in the Ordeal now rally and strike back at them. If the elixir was stolen
from the central forces rather than given freely, there may be dangerous repercussions.
RETALIATION
An important lesson of martial arts is Finish your opponent. Heroes
often learn that villains or Shadows who are not completely defeated
in the crisis can rise up stronger than before. The ogre or villain that
the hero confronted in the Ordeal may pull himself together and
strike a counterblow. A parent who has been challenged for dominance in the family may get over the initial shock and unleash a
221
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
devastating retaliation. A martial arts opponent knocked off balance
may recover his center and deliver a surprise attack. In the Tiananmen
Square incident, the Chinese government rallied after several days of
confusion to launch a crushing response that drove the students and
their Goddess of Liberty from the Square.
One of the most vivid examples of this retaliatory movement in
films is in Red River, when Tom Dunson has been toppled from his
throne by his foster-son, Matthew Garth, in a central Supreme Ordeal.
In the Reward stage, while Matt and his men are celebrating in the
town where they’ve sold the cattle, Dunson is busy recruiting a small
army of gunmen. In The Road Back phase, he comes riding after Matt
with the force of a railroad train and the stated intention of killing
his adopted son. What had been a story of overcoming obstacles on
a cattle drive now becomes a story of a parent stalking his child to
get revenge.
The peculiar force of this passage is carried in John Wayne's physical acting. He lurches toward the showdown with Montgomery Clift
like a zombie, with the unstoppable energy of a machine, flicking
cattle out of his path and shrugging off a bullet from a secondary character who tries to deflect him from his intent. He is the living image of
the angry parental energy that can be roused by challenging a Shadow.
The psychological meaning of such counterattacks is that neuroses, flaws, habits, desires, or addictions we have challenged may
retreat for a time, but can rebound in a last-ditch defense or a desperate attack before being vanquished forever. Neuroses have a powerful
life force of their own and will strike back when threatened. Addicts
who have made a first effort at recovery may fall off the wagon with a
vengeance as their addiction fights back for its life.
Retaliation can take other forms. If you're hunting bear or killing
dragons, you may find that the monster you killed in the Ordeal has a
mate who comes chasing after you. A villain’s lieutenant may survive
him to pursue you, or you may find you have only killed an underling
222,
THE ROAD BACK
in the Ordeal. There may be a bigger Mr. Big who wants revenge for
the loss of his servant.
An avenging force may strike a costly blow to the hero’s fortunes,
wounding him or killing one of his cohorts. This is when Expendable
Friends come in handy. The villain might also steal back the elixir or
kidnap one of the hero’s friends in retaliation. This could lead to a rescue or chase, or both.
CHASE SCENES
In many cases heroes leave the Special World only because they are
running for their lives. Chases may occur in any part of the story, but
the end of Act Two is one of the most popular places. Chases are useful for torquing up a story’s energy. Audiences may get sleepy at this
point, and you have to wake them up with some action or conflict. In
the theatre, this stage is called “racing for the curtain,’ a time when
you want to pick up the pace and build momentum for the finish.
Chases are a favorite element of movies, and they figure prominently in literature, art, and mythology as well. The most famous
chase in classical mythology is Apollo’s pursuit of the shy nymph
Daphne, who begged her father, a river god, to transform her into
a laurel tree. Transformation is often an important aspect of chases
and escapes. Modern heroes may simply assume a disguise in order to
escape a tight situation. In a psychological drama, a hero may have to
escape a pursuing inner demon by changing behavior or undergoing
inner transformation.
MAGIC FLIGHT
Fairy tales often include a chase that involves a whimsical transformation of objects, known as the magic flight motif. In a typical story a
little girl escapes from the clutches of a witch with the help of gifts from
animals she’s been kind to. The girl throws down the gifts one by one in
the witch’s path and they magically transform into barriers that delay
pe)
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
the witch. A comb becomes a thick forest that slows the witch while
she gobbles it up. A scarf becomes a wide river which she has to drink.
Joseph Campbell gives several illustrations of magical flights, and
suggests the motif stands for a hero’s attempts to stall the avenging
forces in any way possible, by throwing down “protective interpretations, principles, symbols, rationalizations, anything [to] delay and
absorb” their power.
What the hero throws down in a chase may also represent a sacrifice, the leaving behind of something of value. The little girl of the
fairy tales may find it hard to part with the lovely scarf or comb given
by the animals. Heroes of movie adventures sometimes have to decide
what’s really important, and toss money out the window to slow their
pursuers and save their lives. Campbell cites the extreme example of
Medea. Escaping with Jason from her father, she had Jason cut up
her own brother and toss his pieces into the sea to delay the pursuit.
CHASE VARIATIONS: PURSUIT BY ADMIRERS
It’s most common for heroes to be chased by villains, but there are
other possibilities. An unusual variant of the chase is pursuit by admirers, for example in Shane, at the beginning of Act Three. Shane has
been out on the farm trying to stay away from gunfighting, but now
the brutality of the villains in the town draws him back. He tells the
little farmboy (Brandon De Wilde) to stay behind, but the boy follows him at a distance. Behind the boy follows the boy’s dog, who has
also been told to stay home. The point is made that this kid is as faithful to Shane as a dog. It’s a chase scene with a twist: Rather than hero
fleeing villain, hero is being pursued by his admirer.
VILLAIN ESCAPE
Another chase scene variant is the pursuit of an escaped villain. A
Shadow captured and controlled in the Ordeal escapes at this stage
and becomes more dangerous than before. Hannibal “The Cannibal”
224
THE ROAD BACK
Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, feeling betrayed by FBI agent Clarice, escapes and begins to kill again. King Kong, taken to New York
to be displayed in chains, escapes and goes on a rampage. Countless
movie and TV Westerns depict a villain trying to make a getaway, then
being ridden down and tackled by the hero prior to a final fistfight
or gun duel. Such scenes were a staple of the Roy Rogers and Lone
Ranger serials and TV shows.
As mentioned above, villains may steal back the treasure from
the hero or make off with one of his team members. This could lead
to pursuit by the hero and rescue or recovery.
SETBACKS
Another twist of The Road Back may be a sudden catastrophic reversal of the hero’s good fortune. Things were going well after surviving
the Ordeal, but now reality sets in again. Heroes may encounter setbacks that seem to doom the adventure. Within sight of shore the ship
may spring a leak. For a moment, after great risk, effort, and sacrifice,
it may look like all is lost.
This moment in the story, the climax of Act Two, may be the
Delayed Crisis spoken of earlier. It could be the moment of greatest
tension in Act Two and should set the story on the final path to resolution in Act Three.
The Road Back at the end of Act Two may be a brief moment or
an elaborate sequence of events. Almost every story needs a moment
to acknowledge the hero’s resolve to finish, and provide her with
necessary motivation to return home with the elixir despite the temptations of the Special World and the trials that remain ahead.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
The Wizard has prepared a hot-air balloon with which he hopes to take
Dorothy on The Road Back to Kansas. the people of Oz gather to see
them off with a brass band. However, it’s seldom that easy. Toto, seeing
a cat in the arms of a woman in the crowd, runs after it, and Dorothy
225
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
runs after Toto. In the confusion, the balloon wobbles off with the Wizard aboard and Dorothy is left behind, apparently stuck in the Special
World. Many heroes have tried to return using familiar means — old
crutches and dependencies. But they find the old ways as artificial and
difficult to control as the Wizard’s hot-air balloon. Dorothy, guided by
her instincts (the dog) knows deep down that this is not the way for her.
Yet she is ready to take The Road Back, and keeps looking for the proper
branching of the path.
eo
Heroes gather up what they have learned, gained, stolen, or been
granted in the Special World. They set themselves a new goal, to
escape, find further adventure, or return home. But before any of
those goals are achieved, there is another test to pass, the final exam
of the journey, Resurrection.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. What is The Road Back in Terminator 2? Silver Linings Playbook?
Maleficent? Isle of Dogs? From the writer’s point of view, what
are the advantages and disadvantages of heroes being ejected or
chased from the Special World? Of leaving voluntarily?
2. What have you learned or gained from confronting death, defeat,
or danger? Did you feel heroic? How can you apply your feelings
to your writing, to the reactions of your characters?
3. How do your heroes rededicate themselves to the quest?
. What is The Road Back in your story? Is it returning to your starting place? Setting a new destination? Adjusting to a new life in
the Special World?
5. Find the Act Two/Act Three turning points in three current feature films. Are these single moments or extended sequences?
6. Is there an element of pursuit or acceleration in these sections? In
The Road Back section of your own story?

STAGE ELEVEN:
ele Ie SOUS GION
ce
“What can I do, old man? I’m dead, aren’t I?”
— from The Third Man by Graham Greene
ow comes one of the trickiest and most challenging passages for the hero and the writer.
For a story to feel complete, the audience needs
to experience an additional moment of death
and rebirth, similar to the Supreme Ordeal but
subtly different. This is the climax (not the crisis), the last and most
dangerous meeting with death. Heroes must undergo a final purging
and purification before re-entering the Ordinary World. Once more
they must change. The trick for writers is to show the change in their
characters, by behavior or appearance rather than by just talking about
it. Writers must find ways to demonstrate that their heroes have been
through a Resurrection.
A NEW PERSONALITY
A new self must be created for a new world. Just as heroes had to shed
their old selves to enter the Special World, they now must shed the
229
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
personality of the journey and build a new one that is suitable for
return to the Ordinary World. It should reflect the best parts of the
old selves and the lessons learned along the way. In the Western Barbarossa, Gary Busey’s farmboy character goes through a final ordeal
from which he is reborn as the new Barbarossa, having incorporated
the lessons of his Mentor, Willie Nelson, along the way. John Wayne
emerges from the ordeal of death in Fort Apache and incorporates
some of the dress and attitudes of his antagonist, Henry Fonda.
CLEANSING
One function of Resurrection is to cleanse heroes of the smell of
death, yet help them retain the lessons of the ordeal. The lack of public ceremonies and counseling for returning Vietnam War veterans
may have contributed to the terrible problems these soldiers have had
in reintegrating with society. So-called primitive societies seem better
prepared to handle the return of heroes. They provide rituals to purge
the blood and death from hunters and warriors so they can become
peaceful members of society again.
Returning hunters may be quarantined safely away from the tribe
for a period of time. To reintegrate hunters and warriors into the tribe,
shamans use rituals that mimic the effects of death or even take the
participants to death’s door. The hunters or warriors may be buried
alive for a period of time or confined in a cave or sweat lodge, symbolically growing in the womb of the earth. Then they are raised up
(Resurrected) and welcomed as newborn members of the tribe.
Sacred architecture aims to create this feeling of Resurrection,
by confining worshippers in a narrow dark hall or tunnel, like a birth
canal, before bringing them out into an open well-lit area, with a corresponding lift of relief. Baptism by immersion in a stream is a ritual
designed to give the Resurrection feeling, both cleansing the sinner
and reviving him from symbolic death by drowning.
230
THE RESURRECTION
TWO GREAT ORDEALS
Why do so many stories seem to have two climaxes or death-andrebirth ordeals, one near the middle and another just before the end
of the story? The college semester metaphor suggests the reason. The
central crisis or Supreme Ordeal is like a midterm exam; the Resurrection is the final exam. Heroes must be tested one last time to see
if they retained the learning from the Supreme Ordeal of Act Two.
To learn something in a Special World is one thing; to bring the
knowledge home as applied wisdom is quite another. Students can
cram for a test but the Resurrection stage represents a field trial of a
hero’s new skills, in the real world. It’s both a reminder of death and
a test of the hero’s learning. Was the hero sincere about change? Will
she backslide or fail, be defeated by neuroses or a Shadow at the eleventh hour? Will the dire predictions made about hero Joan Wilder
in Act One of Romancing the Stone (“You're not up to this, Joan, and
you know it”) turn out to be true?
PHYSICAL ORDEAL
At the simplest level, the Resurrection may just be a hero facing death
one last time in an ordeal, battle, or showdown. It’s often the final,
decisive confrontation with the villain or Shadow.
But the difference between this and previous meetings with death
is that the danger is usually on the broadest scale of the entire story.
The threat is not just to the hero, but to the whole world. In other
words, the stakes are at their highest.
The James Bond movies often climax with 007 battling the villains and then racing against time and impossible odds to disarm some
Doomsday device, such as the atomic bomb at the climax of Goldfinger. Millions of lives are at stake. Hero, audience, and world are taken
right to the brink of death one more time before Bond (or his Ally Felix
Leiter) manages to yank the right wire and save us all from destruction.
231
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
THE ACTIVE HERO
It seems obvious that the hero should be the one to act in this climactic moment. But many writers make the mistake of having the
hero rescued from death by a timely intervention from an Ally — the
equivalent of the cavalry coming to save the day. Heroes can get surprise assistance, but it’s best for the hero to be the one to perform the
decisive action; to deliver the death blow to fear or the Shadow; to be
active rather than passive, at this of all times.
SHOW DOWNS
In Westerns, crime fiction, and many action films, the Resurrection
is expressed as the biggest confrontation and battle of the story, the
showdown or shootout. A showdown pits hero and villains in an ultimate contest with the highest possible stakes, life and death. It’s the
classic gunfight of the Western, the swordfight of the swashbuckler, or
the last acrobatic battle of a martial arts movie. It may even be a courtroom showdown or an emotional “shootout” in a domestic drama.
The showdown is a distinct dramatic form with its own rules and
conventions. The operatic climaxes of the Sergio Leone “spaghetti
Westerns” exaggerate the elements of the conventional showdown: the
dramatic music; the opposing forces marching towards each other in
some kind of arena (the town street, a corral, a cemetery, the villain’s
hideout); the close-ups of guns, hands, and eyes poised for the decisive moment; the sense that time stands still. Gun duels are almost
mandatory in Westerns from Stagecoach to High Noon to My Darling
Clementine. The so-called Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1881 was
a brutal shootout that has become part of the myth of the American
West and has spurred more film versions than any other.
Duels to the death form the climaxes of swashbucklers such as
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Sea Hawk, Scaramouche, and The
Flame and the Arrow; knights battle to the death in Ivanhoe, Excalibur, and Knights of the Round Table. Duels or shootouts are not fully
232,
THE RESURRECTION
satisfying unless the hero is taken right to the edge of death. The
hero must clearly be fighting for his life. The playful quality of earlier skirmishes is probably gone now. He may be wounded or he may
slip and lose his balance. He may actually seem to die, just as in the
Supreme Ordeal.
DEATH AND REBIRTH OF TRAGIC HEROES
Conventionally heroes survive this brush with death and are Resurrected. Often it is the villains who die or are defeated, but some tragic
heroes actually die at this point, like the doomed heroes of They Died
with Their Boots On, The Sand Pebbles, Charge of the Light Brigade, or
Glory. Robert Shaw’s character, Quint, is killed at this point in Jaws.
However, all these doomed or tragic heroes are Resurrected in the
sense that they usually live on in the memory of the survivors, those
for whom they gave their lives. The audience survives, and remembers
the lessons a tragic hero can teach us.
In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the heroes are cornered
in an adobe building, surrounded and outnumbered. They run out
to face death in a climax that is delayed to the final seconds of the
film. The chances are good they’re going to die in a hail of bullets,
but they'll go down fighting and are granted immortality by a final
freeze-frame, which makes them live on in our memories. In The Wild
Bunch the heroes are elaborately killed, but their energy lives on in a
gun which is picked up by another adventurer who we know will carry
on in their wild style.
CHOICE
Another possibility for a Resurrection moment may be a climactic
choice among options that indicates whether or not the hero has
truly learned the lesson of change. A difficult choice tests a hero's values: Will he choose in accordance with his old, flawed ways, or will
the choice reflect the new person he’s become? In Witness, policeman
233
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
John Book comes to a final showdown with his ultimate enemy, a
crooked police official. The Amish people watch to see if Book will
follow the violent code of his Ordinary World or the peaceful way
he has learned in their Special World. He makes a clear choice not to
engage in the expected shootout. Instead he puts down his gun, leaving the villain armed, and stands with the silent Amish. Like them, he
is a witness. The villain can’t shoot when there are so many witnesses.
The old John Book would have shot it out with his opponent, but the
new man chooses not to. Here is the test that proves he’s learned his
lesson and is anew man, Resurrected.
ROMANTIC CHOICE
The Resurrection choice may be in the arena of love. Stories like The
Graduate or It Happened One Night take heroes to the altar at the climax, where a choice of spouses must be made. Sophie's Choice is about
the impossible choice of a mother who is told by the Nazis to pick
which of her two children will die.
CLIMAX
The Resurrection usually marks the climax of the drama. Climax is
a Greek word meaning “a ladder.” For us storytellers it has come to
mean an explosive moment, the highest peak in energy, or the last big
event in a work. It may be the physical showdown or final battle, but
it can also be expressed as a difficult choice, sexual climax, musical crescendo, or highly emotional but decisive confrontation.
THE QUIET CLIMAX
The climax need not be the most explosive, dramatic, loud, or dangerous moment of the story. There is such a thing as a quiet climax; a gentle
cresting of a wave of emotion. A quiet climax can give a sense that all
the conflicts have been harmoniously resolved, and all the tensions converted into feelings of pleasure and peace. After a hero has experienced
234
THE RESURRECTION
the death of a loved one, there may be a quiet climax of acceptance or
understanding. The knots of tension created in the body of the story
come untied, perhaps after a gentle tug from a final realization.
ROLLING CLIMAXES
Stories may need more than one climax, or a series of rolling
climaxes. Individual subplots may require separate climaxes. The Resurrection stage is another nerve ganglion of the story, a checkpoint
through which all the threads of the story have to pass. Rebirth and
cleansing may have to be experienced on more than one level.
The hero may experience a climax on different levels of awareness in succession, such as mind, body, and emotion. A hero might
go through a climax of mental change or decision which triggers a
physical climax or showdown in the material world. This could be
followed by an emotional or spiritual climax as the hero’s behavior
and feelings change.
Gunga Din combines effective physical and emotional climaxes
in succession. Cary Grant and his two English sergeant pals have been
badly wounded, leaving the water carrier Gunga Din, once a clown,
to act as the hero and warn the British army of an ambush. Although
wounded himself, Gunga Din climbs to the top of a golden tower to
blow a bugle call. The army is warned and many lives are saved in an
action scene which is the story’s physical climax, but Din himself is
shot from the tower and falls to his death. However, his death is not
in vain. He is recognized as a hero by his comrades and is Resurrected.
In a final emotional climax the Colonel reads a poem which Rudyard
Kipling has written in Din’s honor. Superimposed on the scene is
Din’s spirit, dressed in full army uniform and grinning as he salutes,
Resurrected and transformed.
Of course, a well-made story can bring all levels — mind, body,
and spirit — to climax in the same moment. When a hero takes a decisive action, her whole world can be changed at once.

CATHARSIS
A climax should provide the feeling of catharsis. This Greek word actually means “vomiting up” or “purging,” but in English has come to mean
a purifying emotional release, or an emotional breakthrough. Greek
drama was constructed with the intent of triggering a vomiting-up of
emotions by the audience, a purging of the poisons of daily life. Just as
they took purgatives to empty and cleanse their digestive systems from
time to time, the Greeks at regular times of the year would go to the
theatre to get rid of ill feeling. Laughter, tears, and shudders of terror
are the triggers that bring about this healthy cleansing, this catharsis.
In psychoanalysis, catharsis is a technique of relieving anxiety
or depression by bringing unconscious material to the surface. The
same is true, in a way, of storytelling. The climax you are trying to
trigger in your hero and audience is the moment when they are the
most conscious, when they have reached the highest point on a ladder of awareness. You are trying to raise the consciousness of both
the hero and the participating audience. A catharsis can bring about
a sudden expansion of awareness, a peak experience of higher consciousness.
A catharsis can be combined with a simple physical showdown,
for a satisfying emotional effect. In Red River, Tom Dunson and Matthew Garth come together for an explosive fight to the death. At first
Garth won't fight. He is determined not to be provoked into abandoning his principles. Dunson hammers at him until Garth is forced
to fight back to save his own life. They commence a titanic battle and
it looks for all the world as if one or both of them must be killed.
They crash into a wagon loaded with domestic goods — calico, pots
and pans — and destroy it, suggesting the death of hope for building
home, family, or society on the frontier.
But a new energy enters the scene: Tess, an independent woman
who has come to love Matthew Garth. She stops the fight with a
gunshot to get their attention. In an emotional climax — a genuine

THE RESURRECTION
A Resurrection showdown is resolved by an emotional catharsis.
catharsis — she spews up all her feelings about the two men, and convinces them that their fight is foolish, because they really love each
other. She has changed a deadly physical showdown into an emotional
catharsis, a moment of highest awareness.
Catharsis works best through physical expression of emotions
such as laughter and crying. Sentimental stories can bring an audience to a catharsis of tears by pushing their emotions to a climax.
The death of a beloved character, like Mr. Chips or the doomed
young woman in Love Story, may be the climactic moment. Such
characters are inevitably “resurrected” in the hearts and memories
of those who loved them.
Laughter is one of the strongest channels of catharsis. A comedy
should crest with a gag or a series of gags that create a virtual explosion of laughter, jokes that relieve tension, purge sour emotions, and
allow us a shared experience. The classic Warner Bros. and Disney
short cartoons are constructed to reach a climax of laughter, a crescendo of absurdity, in only six minutes. Full-length comedies have
to be carefully structured to build to a climax of laughter that releases
all the boxed-in emotions of the audience.

CHARACTER ARC
A catharsis is the logical climax of a hero’s character arc. This is a term
used to describe the gradual stages of change in a character: the phases
and turning points of growth. A common flaw in stories is that writers make heroes grow or change, but do so abruptly, in a single leap
because of a single incident. Someone criticizes them or they realize a
flaw, and they immediately correct it; or they have an overnight conversion because of some shock and are totally changed at one stroke.
This does happen once in a while in life, but more commonly people
change by degrees, growing in gradual stages from bigotry to tolerance, from cowardice to courage, from hate to love. Here is a typical
character arc compared with the Hero’s Journey model.

Return with the Elixir
The stages of the Hero's Journey are a good guide to the steps needed
to create a realistic character arc.
LAST CHANCE
The Resurrection is the hero’s final attempt to make major change in
attitude or behavior. A hero may backslide at this point, making those
around think he’s let them down. Hope for that character is temporarily dead, but can be resurrected if he changes his mind. The selfish

WATCH YOUR STEP
The Resurrection can be a potential misstep for a returning hero who
may be walking a narrow sword-bridge from one world to the next.
Hitchcock often uses heights at this point in a story to stand for the
potential failure to return from the Special World alive. In North
by Northwest, Cary Grant’s and Eva Marie Saint’s characters end up
hanging from the stone portraits on Mount Rushmore, keeping the
audience in suspense about their ultimate fates until the last possible
moment. The climaxes of Hitchcock’s Vertigo, Saboteur, and To Catch
a Thief all take heroes to high places for a final struggle between life
and death.
Sometimes great drama comes from heroes dropping the ball
at the last moment just before reaching their goal. The heroes of
Quest for Fire come back to their people with the elixir of flame, but
at the threshold of their world, the fire goes out, dropped into the
water by accident. This apparent death of all hope is the final test
for the hero, the leader of the quest. He reassures the people, for he
knows the secret of fire; he has seen the more advanced tribe using
a special stick to make fire at his Ordeal. However, when he tries
to copy their technique, he finds he has forgotten the trick. Again
hope seems dead.
But just then his “wife,” a woman he met on the adventure and
a member of the more advanced tribe, steps in and gives it a try. The
men are not too happy about this, being shown up by a woman and
a foreigner at that. However, only she knows the secret (spitting on
your hands before using the fire-stick). She succeeds, fire blooms, and
the possibility of life returns to the tribe. In fact the tribe itself has
passed a final test by learning that the combined knowledge of men
and women is needed to survive. A stumble at the final threshold has
led to Resurrection and enlightenment.
The misstep for a hero might not be a physical event, but a moral
or emotional stumble at the threshold of return. In Notorious there
240
THE RESURRECTION
are both physical and emotional tests in the closing moments. Alicia
Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is in grave physical danger from being
poisoned by the Nazis, while Devlin (Cary Grant) is in danger of losing his soul if he doesn’t rescue her from the clutches of the enemy
where his own devotion to duty has placed her.
THE FALSE CLAIMANT
A common Resurrection moment in fairy tales involves a last-minute
threat to a hero who has gone on a quest to achieve impossible tasks.
As he stakes his claim on the princess or the kingdom, a pretender or
false claimant suddenly steps forward questioning the hero's credentials or claiming that he, not the hero, achieved the impossible. For a
moment it looks like the hero’s hopes are dead. To be reborn, the hero
must provide proof that he is the true claimant, perhaps by showing
the ears and tail of the dragon he slew, perhaps by besting the pretender (the Shadow) in a contest.
PROOF
Providing proof is a major function of the Resurrection stage. Kids
like to bring back souvenirs from summer vacations, partly to remind
them of the trips, but also to prove to the other kids that they really
visited these exotic locales. Not being believed is a perennial problem
of travelers to other worlds.
A common fairy-tale motif is that proof brought back from the
magic world tends to evaporate. A sack full of gold coins won from
the fairies will be opened in the Ordinary World and be found to
contain nothing but wet leaves, leading other people to believe the
traveler was just sleeping off a drunk in the woods. Yet the traveler
knows the experience was real. This motif signifies that spiritual and
emotional experiences in a special world are hard to explain to others. They have to go there for themselves. Special World experiences
may evaporate if we have not truly made them part of our daily lives.
241
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The real treasure from traveling is not the souvenirs, but lasting inner
change and learning.
SACRIFICE
Resurrection often calls for a sacrifice by the hero. Something must be
surrendered, such as an old habit or belief. Something must be given
back, like the libation the Greeks used to pour to the gods before
drinking. Something must be shared for the good of the group.
In Terminator 2 the shapeshifting villain is destroyed in a physical climax, but the story brings the audience to a higher emotional
climax when the robot hero, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), must sacrifice himself to keep from causing future violence. In
another sense, the boy John Connor is the hero at this point and must
sacrifice part of himself, his Mentor/father figure, by allowing the Terminator to leap to his death. A similar self-sacrificial climax is found
in Alien 3, when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), knowing she has a monster growing inside her, gives herself up to destruction for the good of
the group. The classic sacrifice in literature is found in Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, where a man gives his life on the guillotine
to save another man’s life.
Sacrifice comes from Latin words meaning “making holy.”
Heroes are often required to sanctify a story by making a sacrifice, perhaps by giving up or giving back something of themselves. Sometimes
the sacrifice is the death of members of the group. Luke Skywalker, at
the climax of Star Wars, sees many of his comrades killed in the effort
to destroy the Death Star. Luke also gives up part of his personality:
his dependence on machines. With Obi Wan’s voice in his head, he
decides to “Trust the Force,’ and learns to trust human instinct rather
than machinery.
Luke undergoes another personal sacrifice at the climax of the
second film in the series, The Empire Strikes Back. Here he is escaping from the Emperor and loses a hand in the getaway. In repayment,
242
THE RESURRECTION
he gains new control over the Force in the third film of the trilogy,
Return of the Jedi.
INCORPORATION
Resurrection is an opportunity for a hero to show he has absorbed,
or incorporated, every lesson from every character. Incorporation
literally means he has made the lessons of the road part of his body.
An ideal climax would test everything he’s learned, and allow him to
show that he has absorbed the Mentor, Shapeshifter, Shadow, Guardians, and Allies along the way. By the time the heroes of City Slickers
endure their climax, they can apply everything they’ve learned from
a variety of Mentors and antagonists.
CHANGE
The higher dramatic purpose of Resurrection is to give an outward
sign that the hero has really changed. The old Self must be proven
to be completely dead, and the new Self immune to temptations and
addictions that trapped the old form.
The trick for writers is to make the change visible in appearance or action. It’s not enough to have people around a hero notice
that she’s changed; it’s not enough to have her talk about change.
The audience must be able to see it in her dress, behavior, attitude,
and actions.
Romancing the Stone has a well-developed sense of Resurrection
that is realized in visual terms. At the action climax of the film, Joan
Wilder and Jack Colton unite to defeat the villains, rescue her sister,
and reclaim the treasure. But Jack immediately pulls away, putting
Joan’s romantic plot line in jeopardy. Perfection through a man was
within her grasp, but it’s snatched away at the last minute. Jack gives
her a farewell kiss and tells her she always had what it takes to be a
hero, but ultimately he follows money rather than his heart. Colton
goes after the emerald, which has been swallowed by an alligator. He
243
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
dives off a high wall, leaving Joan romantically bereaved and unsatisfied. The action plot has ended in triumph, but the emotional plot
appears to be a tragedy. In effect, Joan’s hope of emotional completion is dead.
From the shot of Joan looking out over the parapet there is a
slow dissolve to a matching shot of her Resurrected self in a New York
office a few months later. Her agent is reading Joan’s latest manuscript,
based on her real-life adventures. It’s apparent from every choice on
the screen that Joan Wilder has changed, that in some way she has
hit bottom, died, and been emotionally reborn. The manuscript has
brought the hard-hearted agent to tears. She pronounces it by far
Joan’s best book, and notes that it was completed very quickly. The
Ordeals of the Special World have made Joan a better writer, and she
looks better as well, more “together” than we’ve ever seen her.
At the end of the scene, Joan is put through a final emotional test.
The agent refers to the conclusion of the book, which unlike Joan’s
real life, ends with the hero and heroine united. She leans in close
and, in her forceful way, calls Joan “a world-class hopeless romantic.”
Joan could have caved in here, perhaps crying about the sad reality that she didn’t get her man. Or she could have agreed with the
agent's assessment of her as hopeless. The old Joan might have cracked.
But she doesn’t. Joan passes this emotional test with her answer. She
gently but firmly disagrees, saying, “No, a hopeful romantic.” Her look
tells us she is still in some pain, but that she really is all right. She has
learned to love herself regardless of whether or not some man loves
her, and she has the self-confidence she lacked before. Later, on the
street, she is able to brush off men who would have intimidated her
before. She has been through a Resurrection. She has changed, in
appearance and action, in ways you can see on the screen and feel in
your heart.
244
THE RESURRECTION
THE WIZARD OF OZ
The Wizard of Oz is not as visual as Romancing the Stone in its depiction of how the hero has changed, and yet there is rebirth and learning,
expressed in words. The Resurrection for Dorothy is recovering from the
apparent death of her hopes when the Wizard accidentally floated off in
the balloon. Just when it looks as though Dorothy will never achieve her
goal of returning home, there is another appearance by the Good Witch,
representing the positive anima that connects us to home and family. She
tells Dorothy she had the power to return home all along. She didn’t tell
Dorothy because “She wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it
for herself”
The Tin Woodsman asks bluntly, “What have you learned, Dorothy?”
She replies that she’s learned to look for her “heart's desire” in her “own
back yard.” Like Joan Wilder, Dorothy has learned that happiness and
completion are within her, but this verbal expression of change is not as
effective as the visual and behavioral changes you can see on the screen in
the Resurrection scene of Romancing the Stone. Nevertheless, Dorothy
has learned something and can now step up to the last threshold of all.
ee
Resurrection is the hero’s final exam, her chance to show what she has
learned. Heroes are totally purged by final sacrifice or deeper experience of the mysteries of life and death. Some don’t make it past this
dangerous point, but those who survive go on to close the circle of the
Hero’s Journey when they Return with the Elixir.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. What is the Resurrection in King Kong? Gone with the Wind?
Lincoln? The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?
2. What negative characteristics has your hero picked up along the
way? What flaws were there from the beginning that still need to
be corrected? What flaws do you want to preserve, uncorrected?
Which are necessary parts of your hero's nature?

place, go home, or continue the journey. But
they always proceed with a sense that they are
commencing a new life, one that will be forever different because of the road just traveled. If they are true heroes,
they Return with the Elixir from the Special World; bringing something to share with others, or something with the power to heal a
wounded land.
RETURN
Quest for Fire has a wonderful Return sequence that shows how storytelling probably began, with hunter/gatherers struggling to relate
their adventures in the outer world. The film’s heroes enjoy the fruits
of their quest at a barbecue around a campfire. The Trickster clown of
249
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
the hunting party now becomes the storyteller, acting out an adventure from the Tests phase, complete with sound effects and a funny
mimed impression of a mammoth Threshold Guardian they met on
the quest. A wounded hunter laughs as his injuries are tended: in film
language, a declaration of the healing power of stories. Returning with
the Elixir means implementing change in your daily life and using the
lessons of adventure to heal your wounds.
DENOUEMENT
Another name for the Return is denouement, a French word meaning
“untying” or “unknotting.” (zoe means knot). A story is like a weaving in which the lives of the characters are interwoven into a coherent
design. The plot lines are knotted together to create conflict and tension, and usually it’s desirable to release the tension and resolve the
conflicts by untying these knots. We also speak of “tying up the loose
ends” of a story in a denouement. Whether tying up or untying, these
phrases point to the idea that a story is a weaving and that it must
be finished properly or it will seem tangled or ragged. That’s why it’s
important in the Return to deal with subplots and all the issues and
questions you've raised in the story. It’s all right for a Return to raise
new questions — in fact that may be highly desirable — but all the
old questions should be addressed or at least restated. Usually writers strive to create a feeling of closing the circle on all these storylines
and themes.
TWO STORY FORMS
There are two branches to the end of the Hero’s Journey. The more
conventional way of ending a story, greatly preferred in Western culture and American movies in particular, is the circular form in which
there is a sense of closure and completion. The other way, more popular in Asia and in Australian and European movies, is the open-ended
approach in which there is a sense of unanswered questions, ambiguities,
250
RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR
and unresolved conflicts. Heroes may have grown in awareness in both
forms, but in the open-ended form their problems may not be tied up
so neatly.
THE CIRCULAR STORY FORM
The most popular story design seems to be the circular or closed
form, in which the narrative returns to its starting point. In this structure you might bring the hero literally full circle back to the location
or world where she started. Perhaps the Return is circular in a visual or
metaphoric way, with a replay of an initial image, or the repetition of
a line of dialogue or situation from Act One. This is one way of tying
up loose ends and making a story feel complete. The image or phrases
may have acquired a new meaning now that the hero has completed
the journey. The original statement of the theme may be re-evaluated
at the Return. Many musical compositions return to an initial theme
to rephrase it at the ending.
Having your hero Return to her starting point or remember how
she started allows you to draw a comparison for the audience. It gives
a measure of how far your hero has come, how she’s changed, and
how her old world looks different now. To give this circular feeling of
completion and comparison, writers will sometimes put their heroes
through an experience at the Return that was difficult or impossible
for them at the beginning, so the audience can see how they have
changed. In Ghost, the hero was unable to say “I love you” in his Ordinary World. But at the Return, having died and passed many tests in
the land of death, he is able to say these all-important words so that
his still-living wife can hear them.
In Ordinary People, the young hero Conrad is so depressed in his
Ordinary World that he can’t eat the breakfast his mother makes for
him. In the Return, having passed through several death-and-rebirth
ordeals, he goes to apologize to his girlfriend for acting like a jerk. When
she asks him to come inside for some breakfast, this time he finds he
ip)
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
has an appetite. His ability to eat is an outward sign of his inner change.
This actual change in behavior is more dramatically effective than Conrad just saying he feels different, or someone else noticing that he’s
grown and remarking on it. It communicates change on the symbolic
level, and affects the audience indirectly but more powerfully than a
blatant statement. In a subtle way it gives a sense that a phase of his life
is over, that a circle has been closed, and a new one is about to begin.
ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFECTION
The “happy endings” of Hollywood films link them with the world
of fairy tales, which are often about the achievement of perfection.
Fairy tales frequently end with a statement of perfection, like “and
they lived happily ever after.” Fairy tales bring the shattered family
back into balance, back to completion.
Weddings are a popular way to end stories. Marriage is a new
beginning, the end of an old life of being single and the beginning
of a new life as part of a new unit. New beginnings are perfect and
unspoiled in their ideal form.
Striking up a new relationship is another way to show a new
beginning at the end of a story. In Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart
makes a difficult Resurrection sacrifice, giving up the chance to be
with the woman he loves. His reward, the Elixir he brings away from
the experience, is his new alliance with Claude Rains. As he says, in
one of the most famous tag lines in the history of the movies, “Louie,
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”
THE OPEN-ENDED STORY FORM
Storytellers have thought of many ways to create a circular feeling
of completion or closure, basically by addressing the dramatic questions raised in Act One. However, once in a while a few loose ends
are desirable. Some storytellers prefer an open-ended Return. In the
open-ended point of view, the storytelling goes on after the story is
252
RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR
over; it continues in the minds and hearts of the audience, in the conversations and even arguments people have in coffee shops after seeing
a movie or reading a book.
Writers of the open-ended persuasion prefer to leave moral conclusions for the reader or viewer. Some questions have no answers,
some have many. Some stories end not by answering questions or solving riddles, but by posing new questions that resonate in the audience
long after the story is over.
Hollywood films are often criticized for pat, fairy-tale endings
in which all problems are solved, and the cultural assumptions of the
audience are left undisturbed. By contrast the open-ended approach
views the world as an ambiguous, imperfect place. For more sophisticated stories with a hard or realistic edge, the open-ended form may
be more appropriate.
FUNCTIONS OF THE RETURN
Like the journey’s other stages, Return with the Elixir can perform
many functions, but there is something special about being the last
element in the journey. Return is similar to Reward in some ways.
Both follow a moment of death and rebirth and both may depict consequences of surviving death. Some functions of Seizing the Sword
may also appear in the Return, such as taking possession, celebrating, sacred marriage, campfire scenes, self-realization, vengeance, or
retaliation. But Return is your last chance to touch the emotions of
the audience. It must finish your story so that it satisfies or provokes
your audience as you intended. It bears special weight because of its
unique position at the end of the work, and it’s also a place of pitfalls
for writers and their heroes.
SURPRISE
A Return can fall flat if everything is resolved too neatly or just as
expected. A good Return should untie the plot threads but with a
253
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
certain amount of surprise. It should be done with a little taste of
the unexpected, a sudden revelation. The Greeks and Romans often
built a “recognition” scene into the endings of their plays and novels.
A young man and woman, raised as shepherds, discover to everyone's
surprise they are prince and princess, promised to each other in marriage long ago. In the tragic mode, Oedipus discovers the man he
killed in the Ordeal was his father and the woman he joined with in
sacred marriage was his own mother. Here the recognition is cause for
horror rather than joy.
The Return may have a twist to it. This is another case of misdirection: You lead the audience to believe one thing, and then reveal
at the last moment a quite different reality. No Way Out flips you a
totally different perception of the hero in the last ten seconds of the
film. Basic Instinct makes you suspect Sharon Stone’s character of murder for the first two acts, convinces you she is innocent in the climax,
then leaps back to doubt again in an unexpected final shot.
There is usually an ironic or cynical tone to such Returns, as if
they mean to say, “Ha, fooled ya!” You are caught foolishly thinking
that human beings are decent or that good does triumph over evil. A
less sardonic version of a twist Return can be found in the work of
writers like O. Henry, who sometimes used the twist to show the positive side of human nature, as in his short story “The Gift of the Magi.”
A poor young husband and wife make sacrifices to surprise each other
with Christmas presents. They discover that the husband has sold his
valuable watch to buy his wife a clip for her beautiful long hair, and
the wife has cut off and sold her lovely locks to buy him a fob for his
beloved watch. The gifts and sacrifices cancel each other out but the
couple is left with a treasure of love.
REWARD AND PUNISHMENT
A specialized job of Return is to hand out final rewards and punishments. It’s part of restoring balance to the world of the story, giving a
254
RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR
sense of completion. It’s like getting your grades after final exams. Villains should earn their ultimate fate by their evil deeds and they should
not get off too easily. Audiences hate that. Punishment should fit the
crime and have the quality of poetic justice. In other words, the way the
villain dies or gets his just comeuppance should directly relate to his sins.
Heroes should get what’s coming to them as well. Too many
movie heroes get rewards they haven't really earned. The reward
should be proportionate to the sacrifice they have offered. You don’t
get immortality for being nice. Also if heroes have failed to learn a lesson, they may be penalized for it in the Return.
Of course, if your dramatic point of view is that life isn’t fair and
you feel justice is a rare thing in this world, then by all means reflect
this in the way rewards and punishments are dealt out in the Return.
THE ELIXIR
The real key to the final stage of the Hero’s Journey is the Elixir. What
does the hero bring back with her from the Special World to share
upon her Return? Whether it’s shared within the community or with
the audience, bringing back the Elixir is the hero's final test. It proves
she’s been there, it serves as an example for others, and it shows above
all that death can be overcome. The Elixir may even have the power to
restore life in the Ordinary World.
Like everything else in the Hero’s Journey, returning with the
Elixir can be literal or metaphoric. The Elixir may be an actual substance or medicine brought back to save an endangered community
(a feature of several “Star Trek” TV plots and the object of the quest
in Medicine Man). It may be literal treasure wrested from the Special
World and shared within a group of adventurers. More figuratively,
it may be any of the things that drive people to undertake adventure:
money, fame, power, love, peace, happiness, success, health, knowledge, or having a good story to tell. The best Elixirs are those that
bring hero and audience greater awareness. In the Treasure of the
255
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Sierra Madre, the physical treasure of gold is revealed to be worthless
dust, and the real Elixir is the wisdom to live a long and peaceful life.
In the tales of King Arthur, the Grail is the Elixir that, once
shared, heals the wounded land. The Fisher King can rest easy again.
If Percival and the knights had kept the Grail for themselves, there
would have been no healing.
If a traveler doesn’t bring back something to share, he’s not a hero,
he’s a heel, selfish and unenlightened. He hasn’t learned his lesson.
He hasn’t grown. Returning with the Elixir is the last test of the hero,
which shows if he’s mature enough to share the fruits of his quest.
THE ELIXIR OF LOVE
Love is, of course, one of the most powerful and popular Elixirs. It
can be a reward the hero doesn’t win until after a final sacrifice. In
Romancing the Stone Joan Wilder has surrendered her old fantasies
about men and said goodbye to her old, uncertain personality. The
payoff for her is that unexpectedly, Jack Colton comes for her after
all, miraculously transporting a romantic sailboat to her New York
neighborhood to sweep her away. He has transmuted the Elixir he
was after — the precious emerald — into another form, love. Joan
gets her reward of romance, but she has earned it by learning that she
could live without it.
THE WORLD IS CHANGED
Another aspect of the Elixir is that the wisdom which heroes bring
back with them may be so powerful that it forces change not only in
them, but also those around them. The whole world is altered and the
consequences spread far. There is a beautiful image for this in Excalibur. When Percival brings the Grail back to the ailing Arthur, the
King revives and rides out with his knights again. They are so filled
with new life that flowers burst into bloom at their passing. They are
a living Elixir, whose mere presence renews nature.
256
RETURN WITH THE ELIxIR
THE ELIXIR OF RESPONSIBILITY
A common and powerful Elixir is for heroes to take wider responsibility at the Return, giving up their loner status for a place of leadership or
service within a group. Families and relationships get started, cities are
founded. The hero’s center has moved from the ego to the Self, and sometimes expands to include the group. Mad Max, the loner hero of George
Miller’s Road Warrior and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, forsakes
his solitude to become Mentor and foster-father to a race of orphaned
children. The Elixir is his skill at survival and his recollection of the old
world before the apocalypse, which he passes on to the orphans.
THE ELIXIR OF TRAGEDY
In the tragic mode, heroes die or are defeated, brought down by their
tragic flaws. Yet there is learning and an Elixir brought back from the
experience. Who learns? The audience, for they see the errors of the
tragic hero and the consequences of error. They learn, if they are wise,
what mistakes to avoid, and this is the Elixir that they bring away from
the experience.
SADDER BUT WISER
Sometimes the Elixir is heroes taking a rueful look back at their
wrong turns on the path. A feeling of closure is created by a hero
acknowledging that he is sadder but wiser for having gone through
the experience. The Elixir he bears away is bitter medicine, but it may
keep him from making the same error again, and his pain serves as
fair warning to the audience not to choose that path. The heroes of
Risky Business and White Men Can't Jump have been down a road of
learning that mixed pain and pleasure. They ultimately lose the prize
of love, must Return without the woman of their dreams, and must
console themselves with the Elixir of experience. These stories create
a feeling that the account is closed and the heroes are being presented
with the final balance.
oy,
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
SADDER BUT NO WISER
A “sadder but wiser” hero is acknowledging that he’s been a fool, which
is the first step to recovery. The worse kind of fool is the one who doesn’t
get it. Either he never sees the error or he goes through the motions but
has not really learned his lesson. Even after enduring terrible ordeals,
he slides back to the same behavior that got him in trouble in the first
place. He is sadder but no wiser. This is another kind of circular closure.
In this style of Return, a roguish or foolish character seems to
have grown and changed. Perhaps he is a clown or Trickster, like Bob
Hope in the Crosby-Hope pictures or Eddie Murphy in 48 Hours or
Trading Places, who swears he has learned his lesson. However, in the
end he fumbles the Elixir and returns to an original error. He may fall
back to his original, irrepressible attitude, closing the circle and dooming himself to repeat the adventure.
For this is the penalty of failing to return with the Elixir: The
hero, or someone else, is doomed to repeat the Ordeals until the
lesson is learned or the Elixir is brought home to share.
EPILOGUE
Just as some stories may have a prologue that precedes the main
action, there may also be a need for an epilogue that follows the bulk
of the story. An epilogue or postscript on rare occasions can serve to
complete the story, by projecting ahead to some future time to show
how the characters turned out. Terms of Endearment has an epilogue
that shows the characters a year after the main story has ended. The
feeling communicated is that even though there is sadness and death,
life goes on. Look Who’ Talking has an epilogue that shows the birth
of the baby hero’ little sister nine months after the main plot has been
resolved. Stories that show a group of characters at a formative or critical period, like American Graffiti or war movies such as Glory or The
Dirty Dozen, may end with a short segment that tells how the characters died, progressed in life, or were remembered. 4 League of Their
258
RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR
Own has an extensive epilogue in which an aging woman ballplayer,
having remembered her career in flashback for the main body of the
film, visits the Baseball Hall of Fame and sees many of her teammates.
The fates of the players are revealed and the surviving women, now
in their sixties, stage a game to show that they still know how to play
ball. Their spirit is the Elixir that revives the hero and the audience.
These have been a few of the purposes and functions of Return.
There are also pitfalls to avoid in Returning with the Elixir.
PITFALLS OF THE RETURN
It's easy to blow it in the Return. Many stories fall apart in the final
moments. The Return is too abrupt, prolonged, unfocused, unsurprising, or unsatisfying. The mood or chain of thought the author has
created just evaporates and the whole effort is wasted. The Return may
also be too ambiguous. Many people faulted the twist ending of Basic
Instinct for failing to resolve uncertainty about a woman’s guilt, and
some viewers felt unsatisfied by the ambiguous ending of The Sopranos TV series.
UNRESOLVED SUBPLOTS
Another pitfall is that writers fail to bring all the elements together at
the Return. It’s common for writers today to leave subplot threads dangling. Perhaps in the hurry to finish and deal with the main characters,
the fates of secondary characters and ideas are forgotten about, even
though they may be extremely interesting to the audience. Older films
tend to be more complete and satisfying because the creators took time
to work out every subplot. Character actors could be counted on to do
their bit somewhere at the beginning, the middle, and the end. A rule of
thumb: Subplots should have at least three “beats” or scenes distributed throughout the story, one in each act. All the subplots should be
acknowledged or resolved in the Return. Each character should come
away with some variety of Elixir or learning.
259
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
TOO MANY ENDINGS
On the other hand, the Return should not seem labored or repetitive. Another good rule of thumb for the Return phase is to operate
on the KISS system, that is: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Many stories fail
because they have too many endings. The audience senses the story is
over but the writer, perhaps unable to choose the right ending, tries
several. This tends to frustrate an audience, dissipating the energy the
writer has created. People want to know the story’s definitively over so
they can quickly get up and leave the theatre or finish the book with a
powerful charge of emotion. An overly ambitious film like Lord Jim,
trying to take on a dense novel, can exhaust an audience with climaxes
and endings that seem to go on forever.
An extreme example of keeping it simple might be the karate
match that forms the climax of The Karate Kid. When the last kick is
delivered and the hero wins, the credits roll immediately in a burst of
final theme music. There is almost no denouement. We know the kid
is bearing the Elixir of lessons learned well in his training.
ABRUPT ENDINGS
A Return can seem too abrupt, giving the sense the writer has quit too
soon after the climax. A story tends to feel incomplete unless a certain
emotional space is devoted to bidding farewell to the characters and
drawing some conclusions. An abrupt Return is like someone hanging
up the phone without saying goodbye, or a pilot bailing out without
bringing the plane in for a landing.
FOCUS
A Return may feel out of focus if the dramatic questions, raised in Act
One and tested in Act Two, are not answered now. Writers may have
failed to pose the right questions in the first place. Without realizing
it, a writer may have shifted the theme. A tale that started out as a love
story may have turned into an expose of government corruption. The
260
RETURN WITH THE Prrsrr
writer has lost the thread. The story will not seem focused unless the
circle is closed by Returning to the original themes.
PUNCTUATION
The final function of Return is to conclude the story decisively.
The story should end with the emotional equivalent of a punctuation mark. A story, like a sentence, can end in only four ways:
with a period, an exclamation point, a question mark, or an ellipsis, the three little dots that indicate your thoughts have just trailed
off vaguely.
The needs of your story and your attitude may dictate ending
with the feeling of a period, an image or line of dialogue flatly making
a declarative statement: “Life goes on.” “Love conquers all.” “Good triumphs over evil.” “That’s the way life is.” “There’s no place like home.”
An ending can give the effect of an exclamation point if the
intent of the work is to stir action or create alarm. Science fiction and
horror films may end on a note of “We are not alone!” or “Repent or
perish!” Stories of social awareness may end with a passionate tone of
“Never again!” or “Rise up and throw off chains of oppression!” or
“Something must be done!”
In a more open-ended approach to structure, you may want to
end with the effect of a question mark, and the feeling that uncertainties remain. The final image may pose a question such as “Will the hero
Return with the Elixir or will it be forgotten?” An open-ended story may
also trail off with the feeling of an ellipsis. Unspoken questions may linger
in the air or conflicts may remain unresolved with endings that suggest
doubt or ambiguity: “The hero can’t decide between two women, and
therefore ...” or “Love and art are irreconcilable, so...” or “Life goes on
...andon...andon...’ or “She proved she’s not a killer, but...”
One way or another, the very ending of a story should announce
that it’s all over — like the Warner Bros. cartoon signature line “That's
all, folks.” Oral storytellers, in addition to using formulas like“... and
261
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
they lived happily ever after,’ will sometimes end folktales with a ritual statement like “I’m done, that’s that, and who'll ease my dry throat
with a drink?” Sometimes a final image, such as the hero riding off
into the sunset, can sum up the story’s theme in a visual metaphor and
let the audience know it’s over. The final image of Unforgiven, a shot of
Clint Eastwood’s character leaving his wife’s grave and returning to his
house, signals the end of the journey and sums up the story’s theme.
These are only a few of the features of Return with the Elixir. As
we come full circle, let’s leave a little opening for the unknown, the
unexpected, the unexplored.
THE WIZARD OF OZ
Dorothy's Return begins with saying goodbye to her Allies and acknowledging the Elixirs of love, courage, and common sense she has gained from
them. Then, tapping her heels and chanting “There's no place like home,”
she wishes herself back to Kansas where she started.
Back home in the Ordinary World, back to black and white, Dorothy
wakes up in bed with a compress on her head. The Return is ambiguous:
Was the trip to Oz “real,” or was it the dream of a girl with a concussion?
In story terms, however, it doesn't matter; the journey was real to Dorothy.
She recognizes the people around her as characters from Oz. But her perceptions of them have changed as a result of her experience in the Special
World. She remembers that some of it was horrible, some beautiful, but
she focuses on what she’s learned — there’s no place like home.
Dorothy’ declaration that she will never leave home again 1s not meant
to be taken literally. It’s not this little frame house in Kansas to which she
refers, but her own soul. She is a fully integrated person in possession of
her best qualities, in control of the worst, and in touch with the positive
Jorms of masculine and feminine energy within her. She has incorporated
every lesson she has learned from every being along the road. She is finally
happy in her own skin and will feel at home no matter where she is. The
Elixir she brings back is this new idea of home, a new concept of her Self.
e
262
RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR
And so the Hero’s Journey ends, or at least rests for a while, for the journey of life and the adventure of story never really end. The hero and the
audience bring back the Elixir from the current adventure, but the quest
to integrate the lessons goes on. It’s for each of us to say what the Elixir is
— wisdom, experience, money, love, fame, or the thrill of a lifetime. But
a good story, like a good journey, leaves us with an Elixir that changes
us, makes us more aware, more alive, more human, more whole, more a
part of everything that is. The circle of the Hero’s Journey is complete.
QUESTIONING THE JOURNEY
1. What is the Elixir of Get Out? Birdman? Parasite? Marriage Story?
2. What is the Elixir your hero brings back from the experience? Is
it kept to herself or is it shared?
3. Does your story go on too long after the main event or climax
is over? What would be the effect of simply cutting it off after
the climax? How much denouement do you need to satisfy
the audience?
4, In what ways has the hero gradually taken more responsibility in
the course of the story? Is the Return a point of taking greatest
responsibility?
5. Who is the hero of the story now? Has your story changed heroes,
or have characters risen to be heroes? Who turned out to be a disappointment? Are there any surprises in the final outcome?
6. Is your story worth telling? Has enough been learned to make the
effort worthwhile?
7, Where are you in your own Hero’s Journey? What is the Elixir
you hope to bring back?

EPILOGUE: LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
e
‘Tve had a hell of a lot of fun, and I’ve
enjoyed every minute of it.”
— Errol Flynn
ow that we have come to the end of the Road
of Heroes, it may be useful to examine how this
model works in some representative film stories. I have chosen Titanic, Pulp Fiction, The
Lion King, and The Shape of Water as movies
that made creative, entertaining use of the Hero’s Journey archetypes
and structures. I also want to say a few words about the Star Wars
saga, which has been much a part of the development of the Hero’s
Journey idea.
Analyzing these films and tracing the Hero’s Journey in them has
been a rewarding exercise, revealing some story flaws but also surprising levels of meaning and poetic connection. I strongly recommend
you try this for yourself on a movie, novel, or story of your own. This
material pays back a rich reward when you apply it to a story or a life
situation. However, before presenting these examples, a few warnings
and guidelines are in order.
265
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
CAVEAT, SCRIPTOR
First, Caveat Scriptor! (Let the writer beware!) The Hero’s Journey
model is a guideline. It’s not a cookbook recipe or a mathematical
formula to be applied rigidly to every story. To be effective, a story
doesn’t have to concur with this or any other school, paradigm, or
method of analysis. The ultimate measure of a story’s success or excellence is not its compliance with any established patterns, but its lasting
popularity and effect on the audience. To force a story to conform to
a structural model is putting the cart before the horse.
It’s possible to write good stories that don’t exhibit every feature
of the Hero’s Journey; in fact, it’s better if they don’t. People love to
see familiar conventions and expectations defied creatively. A story
can break all the “rules” and yet still touch universal human emotions.
FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION
Remember: The needs of the story dictate its structure. Form
follows function. Your beliefs and priorities, along with the characters, themes, style, tone, and mood you are trying to get across, will
determine the shape and design of the plot. Structure will also be
influenced by the audience, and the time and place in which the story
is being told.
The forms of stories change with the needs of the audience. New
story types with different rhythms will continue to be created. The
attention span of the world audience is shorter these days and its
sophistication is greater than ever before. Writers can build fastermoving stories and can assume the audience will be able to handle
twists and shortcuts in familiar structures.
New terms are being created every day and new observations
about story are being made every time one is written. The Hero’s Journey is only a guideline, a starting point for hammering out your own
story language and rules of thumb.
266
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
CHOOSE YOUR METAPHOR
The pattern of the Hero's Journey is but one metaphor for what goes
on in a story or a human life. I have used hunting, college classes,
and human sexual response as metaphors to help explain the pattern
I see in story, but these are far from the only possibilities. Work out
a different metaphor or several of them, if it helps you understand
storytelling better. You might find it useful to compare a story to a
baseball game, with nine innings instead of twelve stages, and terms
like “Seventh-Inning Stretch” instead of Seizing the Sword. You might
decide the process of sailing a boat, baking bread, rafting a river, driving a car, or carving a statue makes a more meaningful comparison to
telling a story. Sometimes a combination of metaphors is needed to
illuminate different facets of the human journey.
The stages, terms, and ideas of the Hero’s Journey can be used as
a design template for stories, or as a means of troubleshooting a story
so long as you don’t follow these guidelines too rigidly. It’s probably
best to acquaint yourself with the Hero’s Journey ideas and then forget
about them as you sit down to write. If you get lost, refer to the metaphor as you would check a map on a journey. But don’t mistake the
map for the journey. You don’t drive with a map pasted to your windshield. You consult it before setting out or when you get disoriented.
The joy of a journey is not reading or following a map, but exploring
unknown places and wandering off the map now and then. It’s only by
getting creatively lost, beyond the boundaries of tradition, that new
discoveries can be made.
DESIGN TEMPLATE
You may want to experiment with the Heros Journey as an outline for
plotting a new story or troubleshooting one in the works. At Disney
Animation we used the Hero’s Journey model to tighten up storylines,
pinpoint problems, and lay out structures. Hundreds of writers have
267
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
told me they plotted their screenplays, romance novels, or TV sitcom
episodes using the Hero’s Journey and the guidance of mythology.
Some people begin to plot a movie or novel by writing the twelve
stages of the journey on twelve index cards. Ifyou already know some of
the major scenes and turning points, write these down where you think
they match up with the twelve stages. In this way you begin to map out
your story by filling in the gaps in your knowledge of the characters
and what happens to them. Use the ideas of the Hero’s Journey to ask
questions about your characters: What are the Ordinary and Special
Worlds for these people? What is my hero’s Call to Adventure? How
is fear expressed in Refusal? Is it overcome by Meeting with a Mentor?
What is the First Threshold my hero has to cross? And so on. Before
long the gaps fill and you can progress to chart Hero’s Journeys for all
the characters and subplots until the complete design is worked out.
You may find that a certain scene matches with the function of
one of the stages, but it comes at what seems to be the “wrong” point
in the Hero's Journey model. In your story a Mentor might be needed
to present a Call and Refusal in Act Two or Three instead of Act One,
as the Hero’s Journey model appears to indicate. Don’t worry about
this — put in the scene wherever it seems right to you. The model
only shows the most likely place for an event to occur.
Any element of the Hero’s Journey can appear at any point ina
story. Dances With Wolves begins with a hero’s Ordeal or Resurrection
that you usually expect to see at the midpoint or end of a Hero's Journey, and yet the story works. All stories are composed of elements of
the Hero's Journey, but the units can be arranged in almost any order
to serve the needs of your particular story.
This is why you use index cards rather than writing the stages ona
single sheet of paper. You can move the cards around to situate scenes
as needed, and you can add more cards in case a movement like Call
and Refusal needs to be repeated a number of times (as was the case
with Titanic).
268
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
You may find that as you visualize your story, you will think of
some scenes that don’t seem to match any particular stage of the journey. You may have to invent your own terminology or metaphors to
cover this category of scenes, as well as tailoring the Hero’s Journey
terminology to suit your own picture of the universe.
DEMONSTRATION OF THE IDEA
Now let’s look at four very different films to demonstrate how the
motifs of the Hero’s Journey keep being re-created with new combinations of the old patterns.
DROWNING IN LOVE
A HERO’s JOURNEY ANALYSIS OF JAMES CAMERON'S TITANIC
e
When the great ocean liner Titanic, on its maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York, scraped against an iceberg and sank on the evening
of April 14, 1912, a story of extraordinary emotional impact began to
form. Stunned news reports flashed around the world, telling of over
fifteen hundred people lost, more than half the souls aboard the supposedly unsinkable luxury liner. Then came the individual stories of
cowardice and courage, arrogant selfishness and noble self-sacrifice.
The threads were bound together into one great epic which, with
its powerful elements of terror, tragedy, and death, was retold for
succeeding generations in the form of books, articles, documentaries, feature films, stage plays, and even a musical or two. The Titanic
disaster became part of Western popular culture, a subject of abiding
fascination like the Pyramids, UFOs, or Arthurian romance.
Then, after eighty-five years of Titanic stories, an unusual coalition of two Hollywood studios, Paramount and 20th Century Fox,
offered the public yet another version — James Cameron's Titanic.
Not only did this one top all the other Titanic-related movies in its
269
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
production values and opulence, it was also the most expensive movie
ever made, costing more than two hundred million dollars to produce and many millions more to advertise and distribute. Director
and writer James Cameron’s vision, requiring the pooled financial
resources of two studios, was so colossal that many observers predicted
the same fate for the movie as the ship. This new movie was sure to
sink, possibly taking the studios and their top executives down with
it. No matter how popular it would be, no matter how fantastically
well-executed were the special effects, such an arrogantly enormous
production could not possibly recoup its costs.
After all, said the critics who specialize in reviewing movies
before they are made, it had so many strikes against it. First, everyone knows how the story turns out. They dance, they hit the iceberg,
they die. That vital element of surprise, of not knowing what happens
next, would be lacking.
Second, it was a period piece, set in the obscure time before
World War I, and everyone knows period pieces are expensive and
often unpopular because they are not “relevant” to modern audiences. Third, the structure of the script was considered as flawed as
the design of the Titanic, forcing audiences to endure an hour and
half of melodrama, the length of a normal movie, before delivering
the iceberg and the action. It had a tragic ending, which is usually
death at the box office. At over three hours long, it was almost twice
the ideal picture length from the point of view of theatre owners, who
could schedule fewer screenings per day. And finally, its featured players were not considered big stars at that time.
Twentieth Century Fox executives, who had put up most of the
money in return for the international distribution rights, had particular cause to worry. The Titanic story was familiar in the U.S. and
the U.K., but not in Asia and other foreign markets. Would the vital
international audiences turn out for a costume drama about a longago shipwreck?
270
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
Well, they did, in unprecedented numbers, and repeatedly. To the
amazement of everyone, including the filmmakers, audiences around
the world embraced Titanic on a scale as huge as the ship itself. Its
fantastic costs were recouped within two months, ensuring that Fox
and Paramount would reap immense profits. It remained number one
at the box office around the world for more than 16 weeks. A sweep
of the Academy Awards, with the film pulling down fourteen nominations and eleven Oscars, including best picture and best director,
provided another boost in revenue. The soundtrack hit number one
on the charts and perched there for four months.
Titanic fever extended far beyond attending the movie or listening to the music. We live in a collecting society, where the ancient urge
to own little pieces of a story can be indulged on a fantastic scale. In
the same impulse that caused Neolithic people to carve bone models
of their favorite goddess or totem animal, the contemporary movie
audience wanted to own a piece of the Titanic experience.
They bought models of the ship, books about the movie, movies about the movie, and movie props such as lifeboats, deck chairs,
and china offered in luxury catalogs. Some even went so far as to sign
up for an expensive ride to the bottom of the sea in a high-tech submarine, to actually visit the wreck of the great ship and the somber
graveyard of its passengers.
As the film continued to be the number-one box office attraction
for four months, people began to wonder what was going on. What
was fueling this unusual response to a mere movie?
QUANTUM MOVIE EVENTS
Certain films, because of surprising box office success or memorable
content, become permanent monuments on the cultural landscape.
Titanic, like Star Wars, Easy Rider, Close Encounters, and Pulp Fiction, has become such a monument. Movies of this type are quantum
events, breaking through old shells and boundaries, flinging the idea
271
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of a movie to a whole new level. These quantum-event films capture
something that resonates in many, many people. They must express
some nearly universal emotion or satisfy a widely shared wish. What
was the universal wish that Titanic granted?
Naturally, I’m inclined to think the movie succeeded because it
satisfies the universal wish for meaning, and that it does so through
extensive use of Hero’s Journey motifs and concepts. As James Cameron said, in a letter to the Los Angeles Times, March 28, 1998, Titanic
“intentionally incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless — and familiar because they reflect our basic
emotional fabric. By dealing in archetypes, the film touches people in
all cultures and of all ages.”
These archetypal patterns turn a chaotic event like the sinking of
an ocean liner into a coherent design that asks questions and provides
opinions about how life should be lived.
As a story on an epic scale, Titanic indulges the luxury of a leisurely storytelling pace, taking its time to set up an elaborate framing
device which has a complete Hero’s Journey structure of its own. In
this plotline, parallel to the central story of the Titanic’s passengers, at
least two Hero’s Journeys are unfolded: one of a scientist-adventurer
seeking a physical treasure, the other of an old woman returning to
the scene of a great disaster to relive a grand passion. A possible third
Hero’s Journey is that of the audience, traveling into the Titanic world
to learn the dead ship’s lessons.
Like many movies, Titanic is “bookended” by an outer tale, set
in modern day, that serves several important story functions. First, by
using actual documentary footage of the Titanic wreck on the bottom
of the sea, it reminds us that this is more than a made-up story — it’s
a dramatization of a real event. The wreck of the ship and the mournful, homely relics of its human passengers bring out one of the most
powerful elements in the production — that this could happen, this
did happen, and it happened to people like us.
272
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
Second, by introducing the character of Old Rose, the bookend
device connects this story of another time with our own day, and
reminds us that the Titanic disaster was not so long ago, within the
span of one human life. Old Rose dramatizes the fact that there are
many people alive today who remember the Titanic, and a few who
actually survived it.
Third, the framing device creates mystery — who is this elderly
woman who claims to be a Titanic survivor, and what happened to the
jewel the explorer is so eager to get? Did Rose find love and did her
lover survive? These question marks are hooks that engage the audience’s attention and create suspense even though we know the general
outcome of the Titanic story.
Titanic begins by introducing us to one Hero of this mini-story,
the very contemporary figure of Brock Lovett, the scientist/businessman/explorer who can’t quite decide how to present himself to
the public. His Ordinary World is that of a showman trying to raise
money for his expensive scientific adventures. His Outer Problem is
trying to find a treasure, a diamond thought to have been lost on the
Titanic; his Inner Problem is trying to find an authentic voice and a
better system of values.
The figure of the scientist-explorer is common enough to have
become an archetype, expressed as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s creation,
Professor Challenger; Allan Quartermain of King Solomons Mines;
the explorer-showman Carl Denning of King Kong; and the contemporary Indiana Jones. These fictional characters are reflections of real
adventuring archaeologists and researchers like Howard Carter, Heinrich Schliemann, Roy Chapman Andrews, and Jacques Cousteau.
Robert Ballard, the scientist-adventurer-businessman who actually
found the wreck of the Titanic, is one model for Lovett in the movie,
and actually went through his own Hero’s Journey in choosing how

the wreck site was a sacred place that should be left undisturbed as a
memorial to those who died on the ship.
In this plot thread, the young scientist is following a prime directive: find the treasure. But through the magic of the old woman’ story,
a tale that occupies the body of the film, the explorer is transformed
from a money-driven capitalist to a true explorer of the heart, who
comes to understand that there are more important treasures in life
than jewels and money.
THE OBJECT OF THE QUEST
What is the Holy Grail Lovett seeks in his quest? It’s a diamond called
“The Heart of the Ocean,’ a name that links the theme of love with
the setting of the film. The jewel is a true MacGuffin — something
small and concrete to focus the audience’s attention and symbolize
the hopes and aspirations of the characters. A diamond is a symbol
of perfection, of the immortal, eternal power of the gods. Its facets,
with their mathematical precision, are physical proof of the grand
design, of the creative hand and mind of the gods. Like the gods, certain substances, such as gold, silver, and jewels, seem to be immortal.
Where flesh and bone, leaf and tree, even copper and steel, corrode
away, jewels remain, untouched, unchanged. They miraculously
survive the crushing power of the bottom of the sea in perfect condition. Jewels and precious metals have always been used, along with
incense, perfumes, beautiful flowers, and divine music, to connect
religious and dramatic presentations to the world of the gods. They
are little pieces of heaven, islands of perfection in an imperfect world,
“doors of perception” giving a glimpse of Paradise. “The Heart of the
Ocean” is a symbol for the idealized notions of love and honor that
the movie reveres.
Lovett ransacks the ship with his remote-controlled robot but
doesn’t find the bit of heaven he’s seeking, at least not in the way he
anticipated. Opening the safe he’s retrieved, he finds rotted pulp that
274
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
was once money and a miraculously preserved drawing of a beautiful
young woman, wearing nothing but the diamond he is looking for.
Lovett makes a CNN broadcast that is a CALL heard by Old Rose
and her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert.
Old Rose’s Ordinary World is that of an elderly but active artist
living in Ojai, California. She isa HERO in her own drama, bringing her long life to a climax and conclusion, but she also serves as a
Mentor for Lovett and the audience, guiding us through the special world of the Titanic and teaching a higher system of values. Her
Outer Problem is how to get across the Titanic experience; her Inner
Problem is dredging up these strong memories that for a long time
have been swimming in her unconscious. She issues her own Call
to Lovett, claiming to be the woman in the drawing he has found,
and asserting that she knows something about the diamond. After
some Refusal to accept her story, he accepts and brings her out to his
research vessel, where she begins to tell her story of the Titanic’s first
and last days at sea.
MAIN STORY — ORDINARY WORLD
Now the movie leaves the framing device to fully enter the main story
and the world of the Titanic. We see the ship in her new-minted glory
for the first time. The bustling dock is the Ordinary World stage on
which the main protagonists or Heroes, young Rose and Jack, are
introduced. Rose gets an elaborate Entrance as one of the beautiful possessions in the entourage of Cal Hockley, her fiancé and the
Shadow or villain of the piece, a sneering “heavy” straight out of a
Victorian melodrama. We also meet the sub-villain, Hockley’s henchman Lovejoy, who executes Cal’s arrogant wishes.
Our first sight of Rose is her hand in a delicate white glove,
emerging from the motorcar. The hands of the lovers, twining and
separating, will become a continuing visual thread. She is elegantly
dressed but feels a prisoner, as Old Rose tells us in voice-over. She is a
DS)
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Hero on a journey, but at this moment wears the mask of the Victim
archetype, a damsel in distress, beautiful but powerless.
Cal represents the arrogance and bigotry of his class and also the
dark, Shadow side of manhood and marriage. He is at one extreme of
a Polarity, representing repression and tyranny, with Jack as his polar
opposite representing liberation and love. Although the Titanic is a
great feat of the imagination, built by honest, laboring men, it has
deep, fatal flaws, the fault of arrogant men like Cal. He has bought
into and identified with the hubristic aspects of the Titanic, believing fully that it is unsinkable because it was created by men of Cal’s
exalted class, by “gentlemen.” He claims that “not even God himself
could sink her.” In the world of myth, a statement like that is sure
to bring down the wrath of the gods, who listen carefully and punish swiftly.
Rose's mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, is another Shadow figure,
representing the dark side of femininity, the repressive, smothering
potential of motherhood, a witchy, scheming queen like Medea or
Clytemnestra.
Rose has received a dark Call to Adventure, being manipulated
into marrying a man she doesn’t love. As Rose Crosses the Threshold
of the gangway with her mother and Cal it is a kind of royal procession, but Rose experiences it as a march to slavery, and the Titanic as a
slave ship taking her to captivity in America. She doesn’t quite Refuse
the Call but is certainly a reluctant hero.
Now we meet the second principal Hero, Jack, who with his
Ally, the young Italian immigrant Fabrizio, is gambling, risking everything on fate or chance. A clock is ticking, setting up a Motif of time
running out, of the general shortness and preciousness of life. Jack’s
Ordinary World is that of drifting and adventure, trusting to luck and
his own skills and gifts. The Call to Adventure comes, on one level, as
he wins the card game and a pair of third-class tickets on the Titanic.
He shows no Reluctance or fear at this level — he’s not the reluctant
276
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
kind of hero. However, the Irony is thick as he declares himself and
Fabrizio to be “the luckiest sons-of-bitches alive.” If he knew what
awaits him, he might have cause to be afraid.
Jack is a slightly superhuman figure who doesn’t appear to have
major flaws, but he will have an Inner Problem, trying to find and
win the love of his life. If he has a flaw, it’s that he’s a little too cocky
and arrogant, which later worsens his problems with Cal and Lovejoy. His Outer Problem or challenge is first to climb into society and
then to survive the disaster. He is something of a Catalyst Hero, one
who is already fully developed and who doesn’t change much, but who
spends his energy in helping others to change. He is also a Trickster
Hero, using deceit and disguise to penetrate the enemy's defenses. In
the end he makes the ultimate heroic Sacrifice, giving his life to save
the woman he loves.
Together Jack and Rose form a pair of Polar Opposites, male and
female, poor and rich, but also express the great oppositional forces of
Flight and Restriction. Jack stands for freedom, no boundaries, not
accepting the limits imposed by society, an Icarus daring to fly above
his station. At the beginning of the film Rose is aligned, against her
will, with the opposite force of Restriction, bound by society's conventions, by the force of her mother’s grasping will, by her promise
to marry Cal Hockley, the dark prince of society. She is a Persephone
being dragged down to the underworld. Cal, like Pluto, the god of the
underworld who kidnapped Persephone, obsesses about money and is
harsh and judging. Pluto was the god of wealth and one of the official
judges of the dead. Persephone’s lover in the underworld was Adonis,
a phenomenally beautiful youth. Like Adonis, Jack comes to Rose in
her dark imprisonment and reminds her of the joys of life.
Rose’s INNER PROBLEM will be to break away from her
ORDINARY WORLD, to realign herself with the freedom and ability to fly that Jack embodies. Her OUTER PROBLEM will be sheer
survival so she can implement what she’s learned in a long, happy life.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Titanic elaborately explores the function of MENTOR, with different characters wearing the mask at different times. In addition to Old
Rose, Molly Brown does the MENTOR job, guiding Jack through the
SPECIAL WORLD of First Class and, like a fairy godmother, providing him with a proper costume so he can pass as a gentleman.
Captain Smith is supposed to be a MENTOR for the entire voyage, a leader and the king of this little world. But he is a fatally flawed
king, arrogant and complacent, overconfident on the triumphal final
voyage of his career.
Jack wears the mask of MENTOR for Rose, teaching her how to
enjoy life and be free. He fulfills the fantasy of many a young woman
by freely offering the gift of commitment. From nothing but a glance
he decides he can’t abandon her, for “I’m involved now.” Later, when
the ship goes down, he gives her the vital knowledge of how to survive by staying out of the water as long as possible and swimming away
from the suction of the sinking ship.
Another MENTOR to Rose is Thomas Andrews, the architect
of the ship. She wins his respect by her intelligent questions about
the Titanic, and he rewards her by telling her how she can find Jack
when he is trapped below decks. In this he is a Daedalus to Rose’s Ariadne. Daedalus was the architect of the deadly Labyrinth, and gave
its secrets to the young princess Ariadne so she could rescue her love,
Theseus, who ventured into the Labyrinth to battle a monster that
represented the dark side of her family.
CROSSING THE THRESHOLD in Titanic is celebrated with
an elaborate sequence depicting the ship “stretching her legs.” This
movement climaxes with Jack and Fabrizio on the bow of the ship,
and Jack exulting, “I’m king of the world!” Jack and Rose have other
Thresholds to cross — each entering the other’s world and both entering a Special World of love and danger.
TESTS, ALLIES, and ENEMIES play out in conflicts between
Jack and Rose and the forces of Restriction. Jack and Rose connect

LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
and become ALLIES when she tries to kill herself by jumping off the
ship. He RESCUES her and wins an invitation to dine with Rose
and Cal in First Class. He enters that SPECIAL WORLD with the
help of MENTOR Molly Brown, and is TESTED severely at the
dinner by the taunting of his ENEMIES, Cal and Rose’s mother. He
passes these tests and stands up to their ridicule, delivering his credo,
an expression of the movie's theme: Life’s a gift, learn to take it as it
comes, make each day count. He wins Rose’s greater respect and guarantees further clashes with Cal.
Rose’s TEST comes a little later when Jack, promising to show
her a “real party,’ guides her into the SPECIAL WORLD of Third
Class. In a sequence of wild music, dancing, and drinking, Rose is
initiated into the world of Dionysus, the god of intoxication, passion, and ecstasy. It’s a test of her society girl standards — will she be
offended by the earthy, brawling orgy? She passes the test by outdoing
the immigrants with her drinking, smoking, and dancing.
The stage of APPROACH is expressed in the lovers’ tentative
romantic dance with each other, including the lyrical moment when
Jack positions Rose at the bow of the ship, making her its figurehead,
teaching her how to fly, how to balance between life and death. If he
is king of the world, now she is queen.
Rose makes a deeper APPROACH when she asks Jack to draw
her picture, trustingly exposing her naked self to him. This isa TEST
for Jack which he passes by acting like a gentleman and a professional
artist, enjoying the erotic moment but not taking advantage of her
vulnerability.
THRESHOLD GUARDIANS abound as the lovers draw near
to the Inmost Cave and the beginning of an elaborate, multileveled
ORDEAL. Dozens of White Star Line stewards stand guard at doors,
elevators, and gates, and a squadron of them, like a pack of hunting dogs, is sent by Cal to seek out the lovers. Jack and Rose, fleeing
from Restriction, find themselves deep in the hold where they face
279
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
an ORDEAL on the level of intimacy. They climb into the Inmost
Cave of the luxury motorcar and join as lovers. In the “little death” of
orgasm Rose’s hand streaks the window glass, looking like the hand of
a drowning victim, drowning in love. By crossing this great threshold,
they have died to the old life and are reborn in the new.
The death-bringing ORDEAL for the Titanic comes moments
later when the ship hits the iceberg, the mute, inexorable force of
Nemesis, that spirit sent by the gods to punish prideful mortals. The
death of the ship and of hundreds of passengers occupies the next
major movement of the drama.
Jack and Rose harvest some REWARD from their death-andrebirth experience. They are bonded, supporting each other in the
struggle to survive. This is tested when Rose is given a chance to escape
in a lifeboat. Sensing that Cal will abandon Jack to die, Rose fights her
way back onto the ship to share her fate with Jack’s.
THE ROAD BACK is the battle for survival, which includes a
classic CHASE as Cal, impatient for the ship to do its work, tries to
hasten Jack and Rose’s death with bullets. The other characters face
life-and-death tests, some choosing to die with honor, others to live
at all costs, and some, like Lovejoy, dying despite their most ignoble
efforts to survive. Act Two concludes with Jack and Rose balancing
on the stern rail and riding the ship as it plunges toward the bottom.
RESURRECTION commences as Jack and Rose fight to preserve the warmth of life in the frozen sea. Finding that the bit of
floating wreckage they cling to will support only one person’s weight,
Jack puts Rose’s life ahead of his in a classic HERO’S SACRIFICE.
He has already lived a full life and has experienced perfect happiness
with her. She is relatively new to freedom and life, and he charges her
to live richly and fully enough for both of them. He lets go of life,
confident of being RESURRECTED in her heart, in her memories.
Rose herself goes to the edge of death, but is RESURRECTED
as the lone lifeboat searches for survivors in the sea of dead faces.
280
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
In a final TEST of all she has learned from Jack, she summons the
strength to swim to get a whistle from a dead officer’s lips, calling
for rescue. With that Old Rose concludes her story, returning us
to the framing device in modern day and counting the toll of the
Titanic’s dead.
The robot sub leaves the wreck in peace and silence. On the
research ship, Lovett tosses away the cigar he had saved to celebrate
finding the diamond, a little SACRIFICE of an old personality
trait. He admits to Rose’s granddaughter that he spent three years
thinking of the Titanic but never really got its message. He has been
TRANSFORMED by the ORDEAL, and his REWARDS are his
insight and the sympathy of Rose’s granddaughter. Is there a glimmer
of romance, a chance to fully live out the truncated love of Jack and
Rose in another generation? He has not found the physical treasure
he came seeking, but has he, like Jack, found a greater treasure in the
new world of emotion?
Old Rose goes to the railing of the research ship, echoing her flying scene at the bow with Jack. She even climbs up on the railing as
she did so long ago. In a final moment of SUSPENSE we don’t know
her intention — will she jump, joining Jack in the sea at last, like a
belated Juliet joining her Romeo in death? But instead she pulls out
the diamond and in a quick flash we see young Rose finding it in her
pocket beneath the Statue of Liberty, an ELTXIR rewarded for survival. With a little cry of final dramatic CLIMAX, Old Rose releases
it into the water where, like Jack, it spirals down into mystery, a last
SACRIFICE that says her experience and memories are more important than any physical possession. This is the ELLXIR, the healing
message the movie means to send the audience home with.
Dissolve now to Old Rose falling asleep, surrounded by photos of her long, full life. Here, after FINAL ORDEAL, is FINAL
REWARD, fulfillment of Jack’s prophecies — Rose is an adventuress, a pilot, an actress, riding horses by a California pier, having babies,
281
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
living a life for both of them, part of the ELIXIR she brought back.
The dark wounds of her family history have been healed.
Rose dreams, and in that SPECIAL WORLD the Titanic
and its passengers live again, RESURRECTED by the power of
the unconscious. Through Rose’s eyes, we pass the THRESHOLD
GUARDIANS of the White Star Line one last time, entering the
heaven of First Class where all the good folk live eternally. (The villains are conspicuously absent, no doubt bobbing in a frigid, wet hell.)
Jack stands at his old place by the clock, a supernatural being conquering time. He extends his hand, they touch again, they kiss, and the
ship’s company applaud this final SACRED MARRIAGE. Camera
up to the ceiling dome, the vault of heaven, and its white purity fills
the screen. Rose has her ELIXIR.
THE END
Titanic is certainly not a perfect movie, and there are boatloads of
critics to point out its flaws — a certain bluntness in the writing: a
tendency to end scenes with crude, obvious utterances like “Shit!”,
“Oh, shit!”, and “I’ll be God damned!” For a while at the beginning
the movie seems to have Tourette’s Syndrome. There is a sense of pandering to the modern audience in an exaggerated attempt to make the
story “relevant” with contemporary dialogue and acting styles; and
there is a one-dimensional quality to some characters, especially the
sneering, unshaded villains.
Although well played by Billy Zane, Cal in the screenplay is
one of the weakest parts of the design, and would have been a more
effective rival if he were more seductive, a better match for Rose, real
competition for Jack, and not such an obvious monster. Then it would
have been a real contest, not a one-sided match between the most
attractive young man in the universe and a leering, abusive cad with a
bag of money in one hand and a pistol in the other.
282
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
The chase scene in which Cal is shooting at Jack and Rose while
the Titanic is sinking strikes some people as absurd dramatic overkill
and takes them out of the movie. Perhaps it serves a story purpose
— Cameron may have felt he needed his heroes to endure one more
round in the belly of the Titanic and used Cal to drive them there —
but another device, such as needing to go back in to rescue someone,
could have achieved the same effect.
Maybe this round of ordeals isn’t needed at all. The movie would
benefit from cutting and this sequence of underwater tension seems
repetitive after they ve already burst through so many gates. The whole
sequence seems to be structured to build up to a climactic shot in
which Jack and Rose run from a wall of water — an iconic tableau of
their struggle with the force of death. However, this shot is one of the
least effective illusions in the movie, for the actors’ faces are queasily
pasted onto the stuntpeople’s bodies by some electronic magic which
has not quite been perfected. The whole sequence could be cut or
trimmed — there’s enough tension, already.
However, we are here not to bury Caesar, but to analyze him —
how does Cameron succeed, what outweighs the flaws in his design?
A GREAT STORY
First, the fate of the Titanic and its passengers is a great epic story in
its own right, and has worked its fascination since the day the ship
went down. A dramatization of the Titanic disaster, only recently
unearthed in a film vault, was produced by a German company within
weeks of the tragedy. It was only the first of many documentaries
and feature films, not to mention countless books and articles, about
the disaster. Like the tragic, fairy-tale story of Princess Diana, the
events around the sinking of the Titanic fall into dramatic patterns
that harmonize with deep, archetypal images, shared and understood
by everyone.
283
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
SYMBOLISM OF “TITANIC”
From its archaic, archetypal name on down, the Titanic is laden with
symbolism and meaning. The ship’s name is a choice that reveals much
about the psychology of its builders. In the movie, Rose asks Bruce
Ismay, the businessman behind the Titanic project, why he chose that
name. He replies that he wanted a name to evoke great magnitude,
moving Rose to comment on the Freudian overtones of male preoccupation with size.
However the movie doesn’t address the mythological origins of
the word “titanic,” which were certainly known to the classics-trained
English gentlemen who chose that name. It refers to the immense
Titans, giant predecessors and deadly enemies of the gods. The Titans
were fundamental forces from the beginning of time — greedy, rude,
and ruthless — and the gods had to fight a great battle to defeat them
and imprison them under the earth before they spoiled and looted
everything. When the press of the time called first-class passengers
like Astor and Guggenheim “Titans of industry and capital,” they
were indicating more than the gigantic size of their empires.
A few years before the Titanic was built, German archaeologists unearthed a Hellenistic temple called the Pergamon Altar that
depicted in dramatic relief the battle between the gods and the Giants,
recalling an earlier epic struggle with the gods’ age-old enemies, the
Titans. This monument is virtually a storyboard in stone for what
would be a great special-effects movie. The builders of the Titanic,
who probably had seen pictures of these reliefs, chose to identify
themselves and their clients not with the gods but with their ancient
enemies, the Titans. They were truly challenging the gods by this
choice. Many people felt, even before the ship sailed, that the builders were tempting fate to give the ship such a grandiose name. Even
worse was to claim that it was unsinkable. That was a foolish blasphemy, challenging the almighty power of God. A superstitious aura
surrounds the Titanic, something like the curse of King Tut’s tomb,
284
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
a belief that the builders called down the wrath of God by their arrogance and pride.
The story of the Titanic resonates with an old literary concept,
The Ship of Fools. Storytellers created this satirical form around the
time of Columbus's first voyage to the New World. One of the first
expressions was Sebastian Brant’s narrative poem, “Das Narrenschiff”
printed only two years after Columbus first successfully crossed the
Atlantic. It tells of'a ship's passengers bound for Narragonia, the land
of fools, and is a scathing depiction of the follies of its time. It was
widely translated and adapted into books and plays.
The Ship of Fools is an allegory, a story in which all the conditions of life and levels of society are lampooned savagely in
the situation of a boatful of pathetic passengers. It is a sardonic
tale, harshly depicting the flaws in the people and social systems
of its time.
Titanic goes in for broad-brush social criticism as well, portraying the rich and powerful as foolish monsters, and the poor as their
noble but helpless victims. The exceptions are Jack, who is poor but
not helpless, and Molly Brown, who is rich but not monstrous. She is
the nouveau riche American who rose from the same level as Jack and
who may represent the healthy side of the American immigrant experience — ambitious, climbing the social ladder, but also big-hearted,
egalitarian, generous, and fair. Titanic is more hopeful, less cynical
than The Ship of Fools, suggesting that a few can transcend their foolishness and victimization to live full, meaningful lives.
The irony of the Ship of Fools was derived from the point of
view, the audience’s knowledge that the struggles of the passengers
are meaningless and foolish because they are all trapped and doomed
anyway. Titanic has some of that ironic feeling as Jack and Fabrizio
exult in their good fortune at winning tickets on a ship that we know
will sink. Irony goes with the territory in a story about a ship that we
know is fated to destruction.
285
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The idea of The Ship of Fools is summed up in the old phrase
“We're all in the same boat.” It shows that despite our foolish attention to superficial differences of birth, wealth, and status we are all
trapped by the absolutes of life, all alike in being subject to inevitable
forces like gravity, fate, death, and taxes.
A ship isolated at sea on a long journey becomes a convenient
symbol of the human condition, of the soul’s lonely passage through
life. The isolation of the Titanic in the North Atlantic makes her a
little world, a microcosm, a nearly perfect model of the society of her
time, in which the two thousand people on board represent all the
millions alive at that time.
Like the ship itself, the scale of this story is epic, larger than life,
big enough to tell the story of a whole culture, in this case of the
whole Western world at that time. This vast story is made comprehensible and digestible by selecting the lives and deaths of a few who
represent qualities and polarities present to some degree in all members of the culture.
Like its epic predecessors, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid, the
Arthurian romances, or the Ring Cycle of Wagner, Titanic tells part
of a vast story, the bridging of two worlds, the Old World and the
New. Within these enormous supertales are hundreds of substories
and epic cycles, each with its own dramatic structure and completeness. No single work can tell all the threads, but the individual story
can communicate the sense, the dramatic facts, of the entire situation.
Titanic has been criticized for not dramatizing this or that substory
— the Carpathia’s race to the scene, the stories of the Astors and Guggenheims, the difficulties of the telegrapher in getting out distress
calls, etc. But no film could tell all the substories. Storytellers of the
future can choose other incidents and personalities to highlight. It
will take the combined output of many artists to fully tell the tale of
the Titanic, just as it has taken Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Strauss,
Kazantzakis, Hallmark Productions, Classic Comics, and thousands
286
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
of other artists to fully tell the epic story of the Odyssey, itself only
one of dozens of epic cycles in the superstory of the Trojan War.
As a story about the rapid crossing of the Atlantic, Titanic symbolizes this century's preoccupation with speedy travel and increasing
global consciousness. It speaks of centuries of European culture passing to America, of the waves of immigrants filling the American
continents, lured by the seductive promise of freedom. In the film
the Statue of Liberty is a recurring symbol of the immigrant dream, a
lighthouse beckoning the newcomer. Poor doomed Fabrizio pretends
he can see her all the way from Cherbourg.
The Statue of Liberty, a gift from the people of France to the
people of America, is a colossal example of the ancient practice of
sending statues of gods and goddesses from a founding city to its colonies to connect them by a psychic thread, a religious tie. France and
the United States went through revolutions at the same time and are
linked by their devotion to liberty, one of many cultural links between
New World and Old.
The context of Titanic’ release has to be taken into account in
evaluating its success. It came out at a time when we were becoming
more aware of a global society and links between Europe and America. Shocks like the Gulf War, the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and
the fall of Communism in Russia joined with unpredictably shifting
worldwide weather patterns to make a time of uncertainty when the
ship of life seems fragile. We were two years away from the end of the
century and in a mood to look back at the beginnings.
The stage was set for the new Titanic movie by the discovery a
few years before of the wreck’s location on the ocean floor. The finding
of the ship was a major triumph of science and a powerful psychological moment. For centuries it has been impossible to find ships lost
at such depths. The Titanic being buried in the sea for so long, then
found again, makes a strong symbol of our surprising power to recover
lost memories from the subconscious. It is a godlike thing to be able
287
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
to go down and see the Titanic, and a true Hero’s Journey to recover
lost treasure from the subconscious.
The discovery led to the fantasy of raising the Titanic, as
described in Clive Cussler’s novel, Raise the Titanic, but soon the
fantasy became a real possibility. The experts agree it is feasible to
raise the pieces of the ship, and many artifacts have been brought up,
but for the moment the consensus is that it’s better to leave the wreck
where it lies as a monument to its victims. The spectacular drama of
seeing live TV of the wreck with its poignant human remains helped
provide the right climate for releasing another Titanic movie.
Much has been made of the inclusion of a young love story as a
factor in Titanic’ great popularity. It was a kind of Romeo and Juliet
plot device, an easily relatable tale of young people from warring factions falling in love.
Romance is the genre Cameron has chosen to present the Titanic
story, and by making that choice he opens the story invitingly to women.
He could have chosen other genres, telling the Titanic story as a mystery, a detective story, a treasure hunt, or even as a comedy. At times it is
all of those things, but the primary theme and design principle is romantic love, and the structure is that of a romance. For that choice he gains
a clear-cut formula with a high degree of audience identification — a
triangular relationship in which a woman must be saved from domination by a cruel older man through the intervention of a younger rescuer.
This triangulated relationship is a familiar pattern in romance
novels and in the country of film noir and hard-boiled fiction. It provides the three-cornered stage for conflict, jealousy, rivalry, betrayal,
revenge, and rescue just as do the stories of Guinevere, Lancelot, and
King Arthur, the romance novels where the heroine must choose
between two men, and the film noir motif of the young woman who
must choose between Mr. Big and the young drifter or detective.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays the drifter corner of the triangle in
Titanic. The secret of his remarkable attractive powers may be that he
288
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
projects the archetypal mask of the sensitive young man, displaying
both masculine action and feminine sensitivity. He is well suited to
play Jack, a Peter Pan, a puer aeternus (eternal youth) who remains forever young by his beautiful, sacrificial death. Rose is another Wendy,
a girl in bedclothes running around a ship dodging an evil Captain
Hook while the eternal youth teaches her how to fly and how to
embrace life. The iceberg and the ticking of the clock fulfill the same
archetypal purpose as the crocodile which has swallowed a clock in
Peter Pan. They are projections of the Shadow, the unconscious force
that threatens to destroy us, sooner or later, if we don’t acknowledge it.
Further back in our mythic past, Jack’s slight, youthful persona
resonates with David, the giant-killer, and especially with doomed
young gods like Adonis and Balder, who die tragically young. Jack
is also a twin with Dionysus, the god of revelry, passion, intoxication, who appeals to the wild side of women, who drives them wild.
The drunken dance in the lower depths of steerage, in which Rose is
drenched head to foot in beer, is a true Dionysian revel and her initiation into those ancient mysteries, with Jack as her initiator.
Jack isa HERO, but of a specialized type, a CATALYST hero, a
WANDERER who is not greatly changed by the story but who triggers change in the other characters. Jack is an ethereal, otherworldly
creation who leaves no trace except in Rose’s heart. There’s no record
of him being aboard the Titanic and he left no legacy, not even a silver
bullet, unless you count Old Rose’s memories. One character, Bodine,
Lovett’s sidekick and a kind of THRESHOLD GUARDIAN to Old
Rose, even suggests that the whole thing could have been her romantic
invention, a story too good to be true. Like all travelers to the other
world, Rose has to be taken on faith.
The character of young Rose is a manifestation of the “damsel
in distress” archetype. As such she is a sister of Sleeping Beauty and
Snow White, princesses caught between life and death and wakened
by a kiss; the Twelve Dancing Princesses rescued from enchantment

by a young man who makes himself invisible to follow them into their
world; Psyche in love with the mysterious young flying god Cupid
(Eros); Persephone kidnapped to an underworld hell by a cruel king;
Helen of Troy snatched away from her brutal husband by a sensuous
young admirer; and Ariadne rescued from a bad marriage by the passionate, artistic god Dionysus.
Women struggle with the “damsel in distress” archetype
because it perpetuates patterns of domination and submission, and
can encourage a Passive, victimized attitude. However, it is an easy
archetype to identify and empathize with, representing the feelings of anyone who has felt powerless, trapped, or imprisoned. The
“woman in jeopardy” is a staple of movie and T’V plots because it
creates instant identification and sympathy and raises the emotional
involvement of the audience. In Titanic the audience can both feel
sorry for Rose in her imprisonment and enjoy seeing her become
free and active as she tears away the “damsel in distress” mask and
grows into the role of Hero.
There may be another factor in the movie's particular appeal to
women. Titanic is a special-effects movie that does not scream science
fiction, war, or macho male adventure. It offers a spectacle that does
not exclude or ignore the interests of women, and is given human scale
with an emotional melodrama dealing with issues of love and fidelity.
For men as well as women, Titanic fulfills another contract with
the audience, providing an unparalleled opportunity for COMPARISON. The movie offers examples of human behavior in a set of dire,
extreme circumstances against which viewers can measure themselves.
People can enjoy speculating, from the safety of their seats, on how
they would act in a similar situation. How would I have handled the
challenge of the Titanic? Would I face death with honor and courage, or would I panic and act with selfish frenzy? Would I fight for
life or would I sacrifice my place in the lifeboat so women and children could go first?
290
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
The movie has the fascination of a train wreck or a highway
smash-up. It’s natural to contemplate and compare when we see such
a disaster, to measure our own luck against that of the victims. We
watch with compassion but also with relief that we are not among
the suffering. We seek lessons and make conclusions about fate and
honor from what we see.
People describe certain movies as spectacular, but forget that the
word comes from the ancient Roman spectacles, which were ritual
dramas, combats, races, games, and contests enacted in the arenas and
amphitheaters throughout the empire. In those days the most thrilling (and expensive) form of entertainment was the “naumachiae,” the
staging of great sea battles, in which the arena would be flooded and
the spectators treated to the sight of ships ramming each other and
capsizing, of sailors and doomed passengers drowning.
Titanic is a spectacle in this tradition. Lives were certainly sacrificed to the effort to put on this show, and the movie itself presents a
feast of death, the deaths of fifteen hundred people being reenacted
for our entertainment and edification. There is still something compelling about the spectacle of death on such a massive scale, like the
gladiatorial combats and ritual sacrifices of the ancient world. A vast
amount of life force is being released all at once, and in an almost
ghoulish way we feast on it. At the sight of people hurtling from a
great height to smash against various machinery our eyes grow big,
as if we are drinking in the sight of death. We study the sea of frozen
faces for signs of how they died and how it will be for us.
Titanic plays on fears that have a high degree of identification
for the audience — the universal fear of heights, fear of being trapped
and imprisoned, fear of drowning in a bottomless sea, fear of fire and
explosion, fear of loneliness and isolation.
The movie offers an imaginable horror. It could happen to anyone. Since it provides a complete spectrum of the society of its time,
any viewer can find an identity there, as a well-off member of the
291
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
ruling class, as a worker, as an immigrant, as a dreamer, as a lover. And
we can appreciate the truth that certain inexorable forces — nature,
death, physics, fate, accident — affect all of us, across the spectrum
without exception. For a while the human story is reduced to one
archetype — the Victim.
Titanic is a coherent design in part because it observes the unities of time, place, and theme. The confinement of the central story
to the time from the Titanic’s sailing to her death concentrates the
dramatic energy. This concentration intensifies in the second half of
the film which follows the surging events in real time, moment by
moment. Confining the action to one place, the world of the ship
alone at sea, makes it into a microcosm of life. It is an island of life in
a dead sea, just as this island Earth is adrift in an ocean of space. And
the ideas and arguments of Titanic are woven into a coherent design
by concentrating on a single theme — that love liberates us and transcends death.
Cameron casts his arms wide in beckoning the audience to
identify with his story. There’s room enough on that ship for all of
us. We can all identify with touches like the Turk who, while the
boat sinks, frantically tries to read a corridor sign with a TurkishEnglish dictionary. We are all strangers somewhere. We're all in the
same boat.
The movie is cast to appeal to a broad range of age groups. The
young have the youthful love story to relate to, the old are invited to
identify with Old Rose, who is still lively and active, and the babyboomer generation is represented by the scientist-explorer and Rose’s
granddaughter.
The movie is not quite universal in that you don’t see black or
Asian faces. Certainly the slave experience is mentioned as a metaphor
of Rose’s emotional captivity, although here is where metaphor breaks
down — Rose’s pampered life is hardly the same as the Middle Passage in the bowels of the Amistad. However, the symbols of Titanic
292
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
seem broad enough that almost everyone around the world can find
something of themselves in it.
Where Cameron is most successful is as a visual and emotional
poet. Titanic is a tapestry, a weaving of plots and threads. He finds
poetry in braiding together the big story and the little story. He articulates connections very well, connections between the little story of
Lovett and the big story of Old Rose’s colorful life, between the little
story of Jack and Rose and the big story of the Titanic, which is in
turn part of the bigger story of the 20th century.
He organizes all this connection by finding a SYMBOL to concentrate and focus it, the narrow eye of a needle to pass all the threads
through. “The Heart of the Ocean,’ connecting in its name the threads
of romance and the sea, is a metaphor tying together all the plot lines,
making them into a coherent design. (Cameron uses a wedding band
to similar purpose in The Abyss.)
The jewel has a European pedigree, was once a crown jewel of
the ill-fated Louis XVI, and makes a good symbol of the treasure of
European experience and wisdom, art and beauty, but also class warfare and bloodshed.
Old Rose’s action of tossing away the diamond at the end is a
powerful poetic image that brings all the plot threads together for
a real DENOUEMENT, an untying of all the knots and a smooth
finish for all the plot threads. Lovett doesn’t get the treasure but has
a shot at love, Cal is thwarted and doesn’t get Rose’s heart or the diamond, Old Rose has kept her secret and now returns it to the sea.
It was something private between her and Jack, hers to withhold all
these years, hers to give back now.
The audience feels the material value of the stone — it’s still a
shock to see something worth so much money tossed away — but
by that shock the whole experience of Titanic is concentrated into a
symbol of fading memory. The emotions, the unconscious materials
stirred up by the movie can recede to their proper place, though the
293
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
memory will linger. As the stone spins away, we see how the filmmaker
wants us to regard the Titanic. Let it remain where it is, a mystery and
a monument to the human tragedy.
Old Rose, like every hero returning from a journey to the unconscious, had a choice to face. Do I scream and shout about my elixir,
try to exploit it or evangelize about it? Or do I simply go about the
business of my life, letting what I have learned radiate out from me
and inevitably change, revive, rejuvenate those around me, and then
the whole world? Do I choose an outer or an inner path to express
my elixir? Obviously, Rose took the latter path, containing and internalizing the treasure from the special world, a poetic lesson taught by
the Celtic tales, where heroes who come back and brag about their
adventures in the Underworld find nothing but seaweed where they
thought they'd collected fairy treasure. But the rare one, like Rose,
keeps the fairies’ secrets and lives a long and happy life.
James Cameron honors his Celtic ancestors with the folk music
that plays below decks and whenever emotion surges. It makes a
strong contrast with the courtly European dance and church music
played in first class, and contributes to the poetic feeling. This is the
epic telling of the Titanic by a Celtic bard, accompanied by pipes and
harps as in days of yore.
This is supported by visual poetry and structural connectedness
like the serpentine braiding of a Celtic graphic design. Simple polarities, bow and stern, above decks and below, first class and third,
light and dark, give strong symmetrical axes for an almost mathematical composition. Cameron’s design offers a number of poetic
metaphors — the boat as a model of the world, the diamond as a
symbol of value and love, the clock as a symbol of fleeting time, the
angel statue on the main staircase as an image of Rose’s innocence.
In the broad strokes of a pop song, the movie provides metaphors
against which the audience can compare themselves, a set of tools
for interpreting their own lives.
294
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
Finally, CATHARSIS is the elixir this movie provides, the
healthy purging of emotions that Aristotle identified and that audiences still want above anything. People rewarded this story for giving
them the rare chance to feel something. We are well defended against
emotion, and the movie hammers away with shocking effects and
strong sentiments until even the most jaded and guarded must feel
some reaction, some release of tension. Shots of panicking passengers
fighting for lifeboat spaces, of Jack and Rose battling to survive, and
of terrified victims falling to their horrid deaths bring the tension to
an almost unbearable pitch, and yet there must be something rewarding and satisfying about this, for people stayed in their seats and many
returned for multiple viewings. They couldn’t get enough of the emotions released by this film. It gives the chance for a shudder of horror
and a good cry, valuable sensations in any age.
The audience witnessing this spectacle goes through an ordeal
along with the characters. Joseph Campbell used to say that the purpose of ritual is to wear you out, to grind down your defenses so that
you fall open to the transcendent experience. Wearing you out seems
to be part of Titanic’s strategy, making you feel something of what
the passengers felt by immersing you in the Titanic world for so long.
In this cynical, jaded time, it takes courage to be so nakedly emotional for both the filmmaker and the audience. Movies like Titanic,
The English Patient, Braveheart, Dances With Wolves, and La La Land
are taking a big risk in being sentimental on a grand scale. The darkness of the theatre offers the audience some protection — they can
cry silently and few will witness their emotional vulnerability. But
the filmmakers must expose emotions in public, under the full light
of a cynical society, and deserve some respect for this act of courage.
IN THE WAKE OF TITANIC
What will be the long-term effect of Titanic on the movie industry? Its
success shows that the big gamble sometimes pays off. Big production
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
values generally do pay off in the long run — even Cleopatra, the film
that nearly sank 20th Century Fox in the 1960s, eventually made back
its production costs and is now a jewel in the company crown. Titanic
turned a profit quickly, and its success will undoubtedly encourage
others to spend big in hopes of hitting the same kind of jackpot.
In the short run, however, some executives responded by setting
tight limits on their budgets. Although the Fox and Paramount executives had won the gamble, they didn’t enjoy the suspenseful period
before the film opened, and they didn’t want to sweat like that again.
Of course they reserve the option of making Titanic-sized exceptions
now and then if all the key executives in the company are agreed that
it’s worth the risk on a specific project.
In all likelihood, other films will be made on the scale of Titanic
and even greater quantum levels will be reached. There will always be
an audience for spectacle, especially when it moves many of us emotionally. On the other hand, small-budget films at the opposite end of
the spectrum can be more profitable in relation to their cost. The major
Hollywood studios are learning from the example of independent filmmakers, developing lower-budget films for carefully targeted, specialized
audiences, to keep profit flowing while they gamble on the big ones.
It’s likely also that filmmakers will be influenced by Cameron’s
choice to build his script around a young love story, which is widely
regarded as a significant factor in the film’s success. It’s becoming a
rule of thumb in Hollywood that an expensive period piece has a better chance if it features a romantic melodrama, preferably with young
lovers to make it inviting for the core of the movie-going audience.
Some critics worry that the weaknesses of the script will become
institutionalized because Titanic made so much money, and that
future writers will be forced to “dumb down” their scripts to appeal
to the mass audience needed to offset the big budgets. That would certainly be nothing new; studios and producers have always argued for
broader appeal in expensive productions. But maybe there’s another
296
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
scenario, in which audiences thirst for more sophistication and reward
filmmakers who try harder to make their stories both more intelligent
and more emotionally universal.
SYNERGY
James Cameron has spoken of a certain synergy that operated with
Titanic, a combination of elements that somehow adds up to more
than the sum of its parts. Just as certain combinations of chemical
elements sometimes produce unexpected powers and capacities, so
the elements of acting, sets, costumes, music, effects, story, context,
the needs of the audience, and the skills of the artists combined into
a mysterious, organic whole which has an emotional and transformative power greater than the sum of the individual parts.
Part of that synergy is the use of the motifs and archetypes of
the Hero’s Journey, such as tests, crossings, ordeals, suspense, death,
rebirth, rescues, escapes, chases, sacred marriages, etc. These devices
give the audience reference points in the long story and contribute to
making it a coherent design, directed to maximum cathartic effect. In
the tradition of the Hero’s Journey, Titanic explores death but makes
the case for the full embrace of life.
Ultimately the success of the film is a mystery — a secret compact
between the audience and the story. Like the men in the mini-sub we
can shine some light on this mystery, but in the end we must simply
withdraw and wonder.
THE LION KING AND OTHER PROBLEMS
In the summer of 1992 I was asked by the executives at Disney Feature
Animation to review story materials on a project called “King of the
Jungle.” It came to be known as The Lion King and eventually turned
into the most successful animated film Disney had done so far, but at
the time it was just another opportunity to use the tools of the Hero's
Journey on story problems.
297
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
As I drove to “animation country” in an anonymous industrial
district of Glendale, California, I recalled what I knew of the project
so far. This was an unusual undertaking, a departure from the Disney
tradition of adapting popular children’s literature or classics. For the
first time it was an original story idea, cooked up by Jeffrey Katzenberg and his team of young animators on the company jet. They were
ona flight back from New York where they had just previewed their
latest work, Beauty and the Beast.
Katzenberg, a recent and enthusiastic convert to animation,
engaged the animators in a discussion of the moment when they first
felt the stirrings of adulthood. He related his own moment of feeling
he had become a man, and they all realized it was an interesting thing
to make a movie about. They began discussing formats and settings that
could support such a story, and eventually hit on the idea of doing it
entirely in the world of African animals. Disney had not done an exclusively animal-driven animated feature since Bambi in 1942, so it seemed
fresh and also could play on the public’s fondness for nature shows. It
would avoid some of the problems of animating humans. To animate
a human character you have to represent a particular ethnic group and
choose certain hair and skin colors, which may prevent audience members with different features from fully identifying with the character.
Much of this limitation is swept away with the use of animals, where
human concerns about race and genetics are less relevant.
A father-and-son story was developed by borrowing inspiration
from Hamlet. Katzenberg liked to bolster animation stories with plot
elements from several sources so that a treatment for The Odyssey or
Huckleberry Finn might be woven together with themes and structure
from It Happened One Night or 48 Hours. The Lion King had elements
of Bambi but was made richer and more complex by weaving in some
Hamlet plot elements. These included a jealous uncle who bumps
off the hero's father and unjustly assumes the throne, and an unready
young hero who gradually gathers his will and strikes back.
298
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
One of my first assignments, after having read the “King of the
Jungle” treatment, was to read Hamlet carefully and draw out elements we could use in our script. I did a Hero’s Journey analysis of the
Hamlet plot to illustrate its turning points and movements, and then
listed many of its memorable lines which the writers could use to playfully evoke the Shakespearean connection. The Disney animated films
were conceived to work for all levels of the audience, with physical
gags for the youngest kids, irreverent verbal wit and action for teenagers, and sophisticated inside jokes for the adults. Some of Shakespeare
entered the script, especially through the character of Scar, the villain,
voiced by the English actor Jeremy Irons. He delivered twisted Hamlet references in droll and ironic fashion, with a knowing wink to the
grown-up audience.
Arriving at the Disney animation complex, I entered the special
world of what would become The Lion King. Every animator’s cubicle
was plastered with photos and drawings of African life and several of
the staff had made photo safari trips to Africa to gather inspiration.
Storyboards were set up in the theatre and I sat down with the animators and designers to see the latest presentation by the directors, Rob
Minkoff and Roger Allers.
Here was an opportunity to test some of the Hero’s Journey ideas
on a major project. I was one of literally hundreds of people giving
their opinions on the story, but for a moment I had a chance to influence the final product by my reactions and arguments. I took notes as
the animators unfolded the story that was to become The Lion King.
To the rhythms of “The Circle of Life, the African animals gather to honor
the birth of a young lion, Simba, whose father is Mufasa, ruler of the
region around Pride Rock. One guest at the gathering is a strange old
baboon, Rafiki, who is chased away by the Kings advisor, a fussy bird
named Zazu. Simba grows into a sassy young cub who sings “I Just Cant
Wait to be King. Disobeying his father, he sneaks off to explore the spooky
Elephant’s Graveyard with his young lioness playmate Nala, and there
they are terrorized by two comically scary Jackals, servants of Mufasa’s
299
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
jealous brother Scar. Mufasa rescues them but sternly rebukes Simba for
disobeying him.
Simba is just beginning to learn the lessons of kingship from his father
when Mufasa is cruelly killed in an antelope stampede, thanks to Scar’s
underhanded trickery. Scar makes Simba think he caused his own father’s
death, and Simba, fearing Scar will kill him, escapes across the desert like
Hamlet leaving the court of Denmark after his uncle killed his father.
In Act Two, a guilt-wracked Simba comes to the Special World of a lush
jungle area where he meets two funny sidekicks, fast-talking meerkat
Timon and tubby warthog Pumbaa, the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
of the piece. To get his mind off his guilt, they teach him the take-it-easy
philosophy of “Hakuna Matata” and show him how they live on the jungle’s never-ending banquet of bugs. Simba grows into a powerful teen-aged
lion and one day has a violent encounter with another lion who was menacing Pumbaa. However it turns out to be Nala, who has grown into a
beautiful and powerful young lioness. Their love blossoms in a romantic
duet. But Nala is on a mission. She tells him how Scar has tyrannized
Pride Rock, enslaved the animals, and tried to take her as his mate. She
pleads with him to return and take his rightful place as king. Haunted by
his guilt and unsure of his strength, Simba hesitates. Like many heroes,
he isn’t eager to leave the pleasures of the Special World. But his father’s
spirit appears (like the ghost of Hamlet’: father in Act One of “Hamlet”)
and urges him to face his destiny.
In Act Three, Simba shakes off his guilt, returns to Pride Rock, and confronts Scar. A fierce battle breaks out. Simba’s “manhood” and right to be
king are put to the ultimate test. Simba’ allies come to his aid, and Scar
falls from power with a touch of poetic justice, echoing the way he allowed
Mufasa to fall to his death. Simba takes his father’s place and “The Circle
of Life” continues.
' As the presentation concluded, it wasn’t difficult to see the Hero’s
Journey elements in The Lion King. Simba is a classic hero whose
ORDINARY WORLD is that of privilege and the knowledge that
he will one day be king. His first CALL is his father’s demand that he
grow up and face the responsibilities of kingship. Earning the right to
rule the land as king is a metaphor for adulthood in many fables and
fairy tales. His cockiness and disobedience constitute a REFUSAL
300
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
OF THE CALL. He receives other CALLS — the temptation to
explore the forbidden zone, a call of childhood romance from Nala,
and most drastically, the death of his father that calls him to enter a
new phase of life in which he has to run away to survive.
Simba has many MENTORS throughout the story. His father
is his first great teacher, showing him the path of kingship and the
Circle of Life, but he also learns diplomacy and statecraft from Zazu
and something of the magical side of life from Rafiki. In Act Two his
MENTORS are Timon and Pumbaa, teaching him their Hakuna
Matrata lifestyle. At the end of Act Two, Nala comes to teach him
about love and responsibility, and his father’s spirit is a supernatural
MENTOR encouraging him to face his destiny. In the climax, Nala,
Timon, and Pumbaa become his ALLIES against Scar. Nala is also
a kind of SHAPESHIFTER from Simba’s point of view, changing
drastically from a playful cub into a sleek, powerful she-lion, presenting him a face of love but also demanding that he do something to
save his domain.
The energy of the SHADOW is manifested in Scar and his
underlings, the Jackals. Scar represents the dark side of kingship,
totalitarian and compassionless. He can be read as a harsh model of
adulthood, in which the early wounds dished out by life have become
excuses for jealousy, cynicism, sarcasm, and a victim complex that
turns into tyranny when the lifelong victim finally gets power. He is
the dark possibilities in our hero, Simba. If Simba doesn’t shake off his
guilt and take responsibility, he could turn out the same way, a rogue
male living bitterly on the fringes, waiting for a weakness to exploit.
The Jackals are a lower form of life than the lions, living by scavenging rather than by noble hunting. They are bullies who readily follow
the tyrant because they enjoy tormenting his subjects and lording it
over them.
Rafiki, the crazy baboon witch doctor, was one of the most interesting characters in the script, combining elements of a MENTOR
301
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
and a TRICKSTER. In early versions, I felt his function was not
clear. He was played for comedy, as a loony fellow who came around
to make magical noises but who’ commanded no respect. The king
regarded him as a nuisance and Zazu, the king’s bird advisor, shooed
him away when he approached the baby Simba. He had little to do in
the script after the first scene, and appeared mostly for comic relief,
more TRICKSTER than MENTOR.
In the meeting that followed the storyboard presentation, I
suggested taking him a little more seriously as a MENTOR. Perhaps Zazu was still suspicious and would try to run him off, but the
wiser and more compassionate Mufasa would let him approach the
child. I had the impulse to accentuate the ritualistic aspects of the
moment, referring to the rituals of baptism and christening, or the
coronation ceremonies in which a new king or queen is anointed
on the forehead with holy oil. Rafiki would bless the baby lion, perhaps with berry juice or some substance from the jungle. One of
the animators said Rafiki already carried a stick with strange gourds
tied to it, and came up with the idea of Rafiki cracking open one of
the gourds in a mysterious gesture and marking the lion cub with
a colorful liquid.
I thought, too, of the presentation rituals in various religions, in
which the holy books, images, and artifacts are held up for veneration. I remembered that the Catholic churches I grew up with had
stained-glass windows strategically placed to create stunning effects
when beams of colored light fell on the altar. It occurred to me that
when Rafiki held up the baby lion to show the assembled animals,
a beam of sunlight from the clouds could strike the cub, giving the
divine stamp of approval to the specialness of this child and to Mufasas royal line. There was an almost audible crackle of energy in the
room at that moment. The image came into several minds at once and
I experienced the frisson, the shiver down the back that always tells me
when an idea expresses the truth of the story.
302
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
The Mentor marks the Hero as a chosen leader.
One hotly argued issue at this stage was the matter of Mufasa’s
death. Some of the animators felt that the graphic depiction of the
death of a parent (even an animal parent) was too intense. In the storyboards, Mufasa is trampled to death in an antelope stampede and
the young Simba is shown approaching, nudging, and sniffing the
corpse, looking for signs of life but finally understanding that his
father is dead. Some felt this was too strong for young children.
Others replied that Disney has always shown the dark, tragic,
and brutal side of life, and that though the company has often been
criticized for it, such scenes are part of the Disney tradition, from
the death of Bambi’s mother to the death of Old Yeller, the family
hound in a movie of the same name. Walt weathered a squall of controversy around Old Yeller’s death, and later came to feel that killing
off a beloved character was a breach of his contract with the audience.
When the question came up on the animated adaptation of The Jungle
Book, Walt insisted, “The bear lives!”
In the end, it was decided that The Lion King would confront
death directly, and the scene was shot as originally boarded. The arguments that prevailed were that the movie was striving for the realism
303
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of a nature documentary, that the audience was used to seeing realistic
treatments of animal violence, and that we were making a movie for
the entire spectrum of the audience, not just for infants who might
be traumatized by the scene. I agreed with this choice, feeling that it
was true to the animal world we were trying to depict, but was somewhat disappointed when the movie then strayed from realism in Act
Two, with carefree comedy replacing what would have been a desperate struggle to survive.
I was bothered by one structural element in Act One — the
excursion to the scary Elephant’s Graveyard. Instinctively I felt that
though it was a good scene, it was in the wrong place. It was a dark
visit to the country of death, and it felt more appropriate as the
stage for an Act Two ordeal. Act One was already heavily weighted
with the death of Simba’s father, and I felt the Elephant’s Graveyard sequence both made the first act too long and overwhelmed
it with death energy. I suggested saving the Graveyard location as
an Inmost Cave for an Act Two central crisis of death and rebirth,
and replacing the Act One scene with some other transgression by
Simba that tests his father’s patience, but with a lighter, less morbid
tone. This bit of advice was not taken and who can say if it would
have made any difference.
I do feel, however, that the movie is weakened by the turn it
takes in Act Two. The almost photographic realism of the Act One
animal scenes is replaced with a more old-fashioned Disney cartoon
style, especially the comic rendering of Timon and Pumbaa. Simba is
a growing carnivore and there is nothing realistic about him subsisting on a diet of bugs. I feel the movie missed a big chance to follow
through on the promise of the first act with a realistic series of tests,
leading to a life-threatening ORDEAL near the midpoint. Someone
should have been teaching Simba real survival skills, how to stalk his
prey, how to hunt, how to fight for what is his. I offered a range of possibilities. Timon and Pumbaa could teach him, he could meet another
304
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
lion to teach him survival skills, or Rafiki could appear to carry on the
teaching of Mufasa. I advocated creating a scene where Simba is truly
tested, a real ORDEAL in which he discovers his mature power in a
battle with a crocodile, a water buffalo, a leopard, or some other formidable foe.
The development of Simba from a scared little cub into a jaunty
teen-aged lion is handled too quickly, in my opinion, with a few quick
dissolves of him growing older as he crosses a log bridge. A montage of
scenes of him learning to hunt, first comically and then with greater
assurance, would have been more effective storytelling. Timon and
Pumbaa add much-needed comic relief to the story, but fail to dramatize the stages of Simba’s development, the individual lessons that
he has to learn. They teach him how to kick back and enjoy life, but
they don’t give him what he really needs. The lessons learned in Act
Two (be laid back, relax, enjoy life, don’t stress out, be scoundrelly and
a little gross, recognize love when you find it) don’t prepare Simba for
the ordeal he must ultimately face.
Meanwhile I felt there was more work for Rafiki to do in this
story. I wanted him to be more like Merlin, an experienced wise man
who had perhaps been the king’s counselor at one time, who pretends to be crazy so he can appear harmless to the usurper, and who is
charged with looking after the young prince as he grows up in obscurity, training him for the moment when he’s ready to take his rightful
throne. I advocated weaving him into Act Two asa MENTOR who
accompanies Simba into the Special World and does a MENTOR’S
function — giving the hero something needed to complete the journey and outface death. Rafiki was needed to teach real survival lessons
that Timon and Pumbaa failed to impart. I envisioned Rafiki showing
up soon after Simba arrived in the Special World, and that he would
guide Simba through a series of escalating tests that prepared him
for his ultimate showdown with Scar. Of course Timon and Pumbaa
would still be there as welcome comic relief.
305
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The character of Rafiki grew significantly through the rest of the
development process. The animators ended up making him a true
MENTOR, a gruff Zen master who gives Simba tough advice and
hard knocks, but also the gift of inspiration, guiding him to the vision
of his father’s spirit. He wasn’t as active or present as I would have
liked, although a couple of brief scenes were added in the first half of
Act Two. Rafiki witnesses the devastation of Pride Rock by Scar and,
thinking Simba is dead, sadly smears a drawing of him on a cave wall.
Later, Rafiki’s shamanic powers tell him that Simba is still alive and,
after adding an adult lion’s mane to the rock drawing, he sets out to
summon the young hero to his destiny.
Rafiki really comes into action at the end of Act Two as he takes
Simba on a vision quest that has elements of a CALL and REFUSAL,
and an ORDEAL in which Simba has an encounter with death (the
ghost of his father) and wins a REWARD in the form of enhanced
self-confidence and determination.
The encounter with the father’s ghost is another borrowing from
“Hamlet, although in Shakespeare the young hero encounters his
father’s ghost in Act One. It made for a powerful scene in The Lion
King, although one that small children sometimes find confusing.
When I saw the film I heard children in the audience ask their parents
questions like “Wasn't he dead before?” and “Is he back alive again?”
The appearance of the ghostly father is dramatic and emotionally
moving, but it plays mostly on the verbal and intellectual level. Simba
gets encouraging advice, but the lessons are not dramatized as tests.
The teaching of Rafiki is more satisfyingly concrete and physical —
the baboon shaman raps him on the head to teach him a lesson about
putting his mistakes in the past.
At the time of the storyboard presentation, the details of Simba’s
return to Pride Rock had not been worked out. We discussed many
options. Simba could leave the Special World with Nala, Timon,
and Pumbaa, agreeing to face Scar together. Simba and Nala could
306
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
go together, after having a parting of the ways with Timon and Pumbaa, who might show up later having had a change of heart. The final
decision was to have Simba go off alone during the night, leaving Nala,
Timon, and Pumbaa to wake up and find him gone the next morning. Rafiki tells them Simba has gone to take his rightful place, and
they hurry to join him.
Act Three marches swiftly to the climactic battle, although it feels
somewhat weighted down by Simba’s lingering guilt over his belief
that he caused his father’s death. Scar dredges it up again, hoping to
turn the lions against Simba by getting him to admit his responsibility for his father’s death. I felt the writers played too heavily on this
note, making the story seem turgid and overly melodramatic, and
turning Simba into an angst-ridden modern protagonist, more appropriate to a novel than to an animated film about animals. However, it
does provide a RESURRECTION moment in which Simba passes
a final test by accepting responsibility for his father’s death instead of
running from it.
The Lion King can be faulted for giving center stage to the male
characters and relatively little energy to the females. Nala is fairly well
developed but Simba’s mother is underutilized and passive. She could
have been more significant in training Simba in Act One and resisting Scar in Act Two. This imbalance is addressed in Julie Taymor’s
stage version of The Lion King, which gives more weight and action
to female characters, and which makes Rafiki a female shaman.
There was considerable suspense around the release of The Lion
King. None of us in the production knew how the film would play
for the audience. The Disney animated films had been climbing in
popularity with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, and
many wondered if The Lion King would fail to top them. To everyone’s relief, it performed even better, becoming the most successful
animated film to date, and the most profitable motion picture in history. Why? Partly because people were delighted by the animation
307
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of the animals and the exuberant, African-flavored music, but also
thanks to the universal power of the Hero’s Journey patterns in its
story. The challenge of growing up and claiming your rightful place in
the world is a classic Hero’s Journey motif that naturally struck something deep in many people. The familiar rhythms of the Journey were
not the only principles guiding The Lion King — in fact, at times,
they were outweighed by other concerns like low comedy and sheer
fun — but I can say that this is one case where they were applied consciously to make the work more accessible to a broad audience and
more dramatically satisfying. The Hero’s Journey bones of The Lion
King ensure that it will have a long life, already spawning a Broadway musical hit, a digitally animated remake (2019) directed by Jon
Favreau, and countless sequels and animated series to be found on the
Disney+ streaming service.
HEROIC JOURNEYS IN PULP FICTION
with reference to the screenplay
by Quentin Tarantino, from stories
by Tarantino and Roger Roberts Avary
In the late 1990s, the film that young people were most interested in
talking about was Pulp Fiction. They wanted to know how on earth
the structure of the Hero’s Journey could be found in that film. Its
defiance of the conventions of structure, content, framing, dialogue,
and editing intrigued them. They enjoyed its passionate intensity
and sardonic humor. Some people were offended by its vulgarity
and flashes of violence, but most admired the film for proving that
unorthodox subject matter and uncompromising style can be both
entertaining and highly successful. However, despite its innovative
qualities, Pulp Fiction can be interpreted with the reliable old tools
of the mythic Hero’s Journey. Seen this way, the film in fact presents
at least three distinct journeys for three different heroes; Vincent,
Jules, and Butch.
308
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
THE POSTMODERN MIRROR
Young people may have responded to Pulp Fiction because it reflects
the postmodern artistic sensibility they grew up with. Postmodernism is the result of a world blown apart, fragmented into millions of
pieces by a century of war, social disruption, and rapid technological change. The doors of perception have been shattered by machines
and the frantic pace of electronification. Young people now come to
awareness in a high-intensity bombardment of random images and
brief story segments torn from all the previous styles of art and literature. The bits may have an internal consistency and obey some rules
of the old story world, but they assault the consciousness of the young
in no apparent order.
Young people perceive the world as reflections in a shattered mirror, whether they channel-surf to cut up the stories themselves or have
the stories chopped up for them by staccato editing styles. They are
accustomed to juggling story lines, time periods, and genres at staggering speed. Because of the archival nature of television, constantly
churning images and eras, postmodern kids live in a stew of styles. The
young can costume themselves in fashions ranging from ‘60s hippie to
heavy metal headbanger, from cowboy to surf dude, from gangsta to
grunger to preppie. They master the idioms and attitudes of all these
options and more. They are comfortable with randomly sampling bits
of entertainment and information without concern for the old world’s
notions of time and sequence.
Pulp Fiction reflects the postmodern condition in both style and
content. Postmodernism is most apparent in its unusual structure,
which disregards the conventional cinema's respect for linear time.
The sequences appear to have been sliced up with a samurai sword
and thrown in the air, although in fact the order of scenes has been
carefully chosen to develop a coherent theme and produce a definite emotional effect. The signs of postmodernism are also present
in the film’s content. The nightclub where Vincent and Mia dance
309
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
is a perfect postmodern microcosm. Contemporary characters find
themselves in an environment peopled by icons of former eras — Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Elvis Presley, Jayne Mansfield, Ed Sullivan,
Buddy Holly, Dean Martin, and Jerry Lewis. Most of these people
are dead, but they eerily live on through their immortal images. Vincent and Mia perform novelty dances from the 1960s to music that
hasn’t been heard in movies for thirty years. Pulp Fiction is part of
the pop-culture jet stream, flowing easily out of the current collective unconscious, charged with images and sounds from previous eras.
RELATIVITY AND WORLD CULTURE
Pulp Fiction is postmodern also in its sense of cultural relativity.
Although the film is set in America, it is shot through with a sense of
worldwide culture and a global viewpoint. The characters are constantly
comparing one culture to another, one set of standards to another. Jules
and Vincent discuss the peculiar way American fast food is named and
consumed in other countries, and marvel at drug laws in other lands.
Butch, the American boxer, compares notes with a South American
woman cabdriver on personal names in different cultures — her Spanish name is poetic and meaningful, while in America, he says, our names
don’t mean anything. This consciousness of other cultures may have
contributed to the film’s worldwide popularity.
The characters in Pulp Fiction are engaged in debate about value
systems, reflecting the postmodern sense that no single code of ethics
is adequate anymore. Jules and Vincent argue the moral significance of
foot massage and the cosmic importance of a pattern of bullet holes.
Where Vincent sees a meaningless accident requiring no response,
Jules sees a divine miracle demanding a complete change of behavior.
In the postmodern universe, everything is relative, and moral values
are the most relative of all. Although the audience has seen Jules as
a cold-blooded killer, he can seem like a hero compared with those
around him. The story appears to say that Western society’s narrow
310
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
value judgments about morality are outdated. In the new world, each
person must select his or her own moral code, argue it fiercely, and
live or die by it.
THE ETERNAL TRIANGLE IN PULP FICTION
One of the pop-culture streams tapped by Pulp Fiction is the tradition of film noir and its sources in the hard-boiled fiction of 1930s
and ‘40s pulp magazines. Like Titanic, the film employs the powerful archetype of the Eternal Triangle. The Mr. Big of Pulp Fiction is
Marsellus Wallace, mysterious crime boss; the Young Woman is Mia,
Marsellus’s wife; and Vincent is the Young Man, who as usual finds
himself attracted to the Young Woman, testing their loyalty to Mr.
Big. Vincent passes through this ordeal without betraying Mr. Big,
like a Grail-questing knight refusing to yield to grievous bodily temptation. But, as we shall see, in another arena, another branch of his
Hero’s Journey, Vincent fails a more spiritual test.
“PROLOGUE”
AN ORDINARY WORLD
In Pulp Fiction’s opening segment, titled “Prologue,” two young people sit talking in a “normal Denny’s, Spires-like coffee shop in Los
Angeles.” What could be more ordinary than this world? However,
it turns out this young man (Pumpkin) and woman (Honey Bunny)
are discussing the pros and cons of various forms of armed robbery.
It’s a different kind of ORDINARY WORLD, an underworld of lowlevel criminals, a world most of us would rather not think about. It’s
too horrifying to consider that all around us are legions of dull-witted crooks waiting for their chance to rob us or kill us, perhaps sitting
right across from us in our favorite °50s coffee shop.
Pumpkin’s first words are characteristic of a REFUSAL — “No,
forget it, it’s too risky. I’m through doin’ that shit.” Apparently
Honey Bunny has just issued a CALL by proposing they rob
31
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
another liquor store, their line of crime until now (their ORDINARY WORLD). While demeaning Asians and Jews who run
liquor stores, the English-accented Pumpkin talks himself and
Honey Bunny into robbing the restaurant, where there are no security guards or cameras, and where the employees have no need to
play hero. He evokes a MENTOR of sorts, referring to the story
of a bank robbery in which the robbers used terror and trickery to
seize control. Working each other into a frenzy, Pumpkin and his
daffy girlfriend CROSS THE THRESHOLD, waving their guns,
bringing the possibility of instant death into play. Then with a swirl
of retro surfer music, we are thrown into the main titles and the
body of the movie.
This opening sequence exercises the cinematic rule of “Disorientation leads to suggestibility.” You don’t know if these punks are the
heroes of the story or, as it turns out, mere bookends. The filmmaker's intention is to leave you a bit disoriented and guessing about their
importance. You're also left guessing about the fate of these hotheads
and the people in the restaurant.
VINCENT anp JULES
Now for the first time, we see our two protagonists, Vincent Vega and
Jules Winnfield, driving in a big American car. They, too, are in their
ORDINARY WORLD having a mundane conversation about the
subtle differences in fast-food menus and customs in the countries
of Europe. Vincent has spent some time in Europe where things are
different — a Big Mac is called Le Big Mac in France, and the rules
about drugs in Amsterdam are different. He has been to a SPECIAL
WORLD and has the experienced air of a hero reliving a previous
adventure.
Vincent and Jules stop at an apartment building and take guns
from the trunk of their car. The feeling is that this is just another day
at the office for them, a routine job in their Ordinary World.
312
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
As they approach the apartment to perform their mission, the
conversation turns to Mia (a SHAPESHIFTER), wife of their criminal boss Marsellus Wallace (Mr. Big). This is the first note ofa CALL
TO ADVENTURE for Vincent, who has been put in the difficult
position of being asked by Marsellus to escort his wife on a date
while he’s in Florida. The danger of this Call is made clear (a form
of REFUSAL) in the complex philosophical discussion about foot
massage. Jules points out that a Samoan gangster named Antoine Roccamora was thrown off his balcony into a greenhouse just for giving
Mia a foot rub. Jules thinks the punishment was out of proportion
to the crime, but Vincent understands very well that a foot massage
could be a sensual experience and could get you killed. Nonetheless
he has accepted the Call and will be Mia's escort. He promises not to
get in trouble with Mia and denies that it will even be a real date, but
Jules is skeptical.
After a long pause at the door, they CROSS A THRESHOLD,
entering the apartment of Three Young Guys “obviously in over their
heads.” They have something which Marsellus Wallace wants, and
apparently they have tried to stiff him in a deal for the contents of a
mysterious briefcase. Jules, menacingly standing over the leader, Brett,
intimidates him by eating his fast food and questioning him about
what restaurant he bought it from. It’s not a Wendy’s or McDonald's
hamburger, it’s a Big Kahuna burger. Kahuna is Hawaiian magic, so it
suggests big magic coming. Certainly there is magic in the briefcase,
whose glowing contents hypnotize Vincent when he opens it to check
on them. What’s in the briefcase? It doesn’t matter because it’s just a
MacGufhin, and in keeping with the Hitchcock tradition, Tarantino
never bothers to say what it really is. It’s enough that it’s something of
importance to the characters, something worth the risk of dying for.
It’s a Holy Grail or a Golden Fleece, a symbol of all the desires that
draw heroes into quests.
313
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Confronting the terrified young men, Vincent and Jules are
HERALDS bringing a fatal CALL, acting at this moment as the allies
of Death, the servants of the SHADOW. They are agents of Nemesis, the goddess of retribution, who brings punishment on those who
offend the order of the gods. The god in this case is Marsellus Wallace. Brett and Roger have offended Mr. Big by trying to cheat him in
the deal for the briefcase.
Jules makes his power manifest by shooting Roger without provocation. Before executing Brett, Jules performs a ritual, reciting the
Bible passage from Ezekiel 25:17 which is his trademark:
“The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in
the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the
valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder
of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy
my brother. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my
vengeance upon you.”
This, in effect, is a statement of the theme of the movie, a complex statement that can be interpreted many ways. On this reading,
Jules seems to identify with only part of the message, the part about
“great vengeance and furious anger,’ for he and Vincent empty their
guns into Brett when the speech is done.
Then a miracle occurs. While Jules’s friend Marvin, who has been
there all along, mutters in a corner, a Fourth Young Man bursts out of
the bathroom, firing away at Jules and Vincent with a heavy handgun.
The miracle is that the bullets seem to have no effect. The Young Man
is blown off his feet by return fire from Jules and Vincent.
This sequence establishes the Ordinary World for the protagonists of this thread of the story. They are enforcers for a powerful
gangster, a notch or two above the level of the two kids in the coffee
shop, but not far above. They are trying to work out an ethical system
314
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
between them, and are concerned about the limits of honor and duty.
The twin heroes are traveling down the same road so far, but their
paths are about to split because of their differing reactions to the miracle that has just occurred.
“VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE’S WIFE”
A title card now establishes that the prologue or framing device is over
and the first of the pulp fiction short stories is about to begin. But
before bringing Vincent and Mia together, the storytellers introduce
two new characters, Marsellus Wallace and Butch Coolidge, projecting ahead to Butch’s story thread. Marsellus, described as sounding
like “a cross between a gangster and a king,” sits talking to Butch, a
knocked-around prizefighter. In Butch’s Hero’s Journey, he is in his
ORDINARY WORLD, getting a dark CALL to throw a fight.
Marsellus is both HERALD and MENTOR, godlike, seen only
from behind, possessed ofa MENTOR’S wisdom and a definite philosophy of life. Perhaps significantly, he has a Band-Aid on the back
of his neck. Was he simply cut while shaving his perfectly bald head,
or does the Band-Aid cover something more sinister — like the alien
brain implants from the 1950s classic Invaders from Mars? Like the
glowing contents of the briefcase, it poses a puzzle which the moviemakers decline to solve.
Marsellus counsels Butch to swallow his pride and give up his
shot at being featherweight champion of the world in return for the
sure thing. Butch doesn’t hesitate before accepting his Call to throw
the fight. He takes the money unhesitatingly. He seems to be accepting the Call, but in fact, as we later learn, he is planning to REFUSE
this particular Call, intending instead to win the fight and collect big
money by betting on himself.
Vincent and Jules enter with the briefcase, but are dressed quite
differently than in the previous scene. They wear T-shirts and shorts,
which look a little out of place in the bar. Later we'll see that several
315
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
days have passed since we last saw Vincent and Jules, and that they
have been through several major ORDEALS.
Vincent clashes with Butch, mocking him as a washed-up
palooka, in a confrontation typical of the TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES phase. Vincent throws a challenge, which Butch refuses to rise
to. The chance encounter with Butch is a TEST which shows a flaw
in Vincent, a lack of respect for his elders. He should know that Butch
is an experienced hero, a potential MENTOR who could teach him
a few things, but instead he makes fun of him. Butch’s REFUSAL to
rise to this challenge shows that he is mature and careful. He sees that
Vincent is a friend of Marsellus and wisely decides to let it ride — for
now. However, a potential ALLY has been turned into an ENEMY
by Vincent's arrogance.
The thread now follows Vincent, who has previously received
the CALL to take Mia on a date. In keeping with the criminal underworld theme, Vincent approaches his own kind of MENTOR — his
drug dealer, Lance — before CROSSING THE THRESHOLD to
deal with Mia. The Mentor’s lair is an old house in Echo Park. This
Mentor, like a shaman equipping a hunter with magic potions and
healing herbs, presents an array of heroin options for Vincent’s selection. Vincent pays top dollar for the strongest stuff.
Vincent shoots up and cruises over in a blissful daze to pick
up Mia. Here is another of Vincent's flaws — he is weakened by
his drug addiction. Vincent CROSSES A THRESHOLD as he
enters Marsellus’s house. He passes by strange metal sculptures, like
THRESHOLD GUARDIANS from some primeval culture. There’s
a sense that the gods are watching.
Inside, Mia operates in the godlike realm of Mr. Big, playing
with Marsellus’s toys. Like Mr. Big in many noir movies, she watches
from a hidden upper room, manipulating Vincent by remote control
with her disembodied voice. The rules are different in this SPECIAL WORLD. In Vincent’s ORDINARY WORLD, he and his
316
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
gun are the absolute rulers. Here, a barefoot woman holds the power
of life and death. She calls the tune and selects the theme music for
the evening.
Moving further into the SPECIAL WORLD, Vincent takes Mia
to the strange ‘50s cafe for a TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES scene.
Jackrabbit Slim’s is a model of the postmodern world, in which images
of the recent past are continually chopped up, recycled, and harnessed
to new tasks. Legendary faces like Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, and Buddy
Holly are reduced to waiting tables and delivering hamburgers.
In a typical Hero’s Journey Stage Six bar scene, Mia and Vincent TEST each other out. Menu choices assume great importance
as clues to character. Phallic cigarettes are rolled and ignited. They
get the measure of one another through cool but probing dialogue.
Vincent boldly tests Mia by asking about her relationship with the
fellow who was thrown out the window. He passes her TESTS by
asking diplomatically, without assuming she was in the wrong. They
become ALLIES.
They are linked in another way, revealed when Mia gets up to
“powder her nose,’ in fact, to snort cocaine. Like Vincent she is weakened by her addiction and it will lead to her ORDEAL.
The cue to enter the dance contest is an APPROACH, moying them a step closer to the life-and-death matter of sex. From the
way they groove together on the dance floor, it’s clear they would
have fantastic sex. Their dance moves and hand gestures reflect the
SHAPESHIFTER archetype, as they try out various masks and identities in the APPROACH to love.
Vincent and Mia return to her house to face a SUPREME
ORDEAL. Mia is looking very seductive, and Vincent retires to
the bathroom to steel himself. He talks to his image in the mirror,
convincing himself not to have sex with Mia. In this area, at least,
he passes an important TEST, remaining loyal to his boss despite
strong temptation. His motivation may not be so noble — he knows
317
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Marsellus will probably find out and kill him if he does fool around
with Mia — but he passes the TEST nonetheless.
Meanwhile Mia finds Vincent’s heroin in his coat, and mistaking it for cocaine, snorts it greedily and passes out. Vincent finds her
with blood running from her nose and panics. Here Vincent is not
just facing Mia’s death, but also his own — for he will surely be killed
if Mia dies. It was his heroin, his weakness, that caused the problem,
along with Mia’s lust for sensation.
Vincent races to his Mentor’s house (THE ROAD BACK)
where a frantic search for a medical book, a marker pen, and a huge
adrenaline needle commences. Vincent digs deep for the hero’s courage to plunge the needle into Mia's heart. In a weird reversal of the
classic scene from vampire movies, driving a stake into her heart is
actually the way to bring her abruptly back to life, a RESURRECTION. Vincent, like Sir Lancelot, has the godlike power to bring
someone back from the land of the dead.
Vincent returns Mia to her house (RETURN WITH THE
ELIXIR) where, pale and wan, she gives him a kind of ELIXIR,
a feeble joke from the TV pilot she appeared in. They part with
another ELIXIR, a sense of friendship and mutual respect arising
from sharing an ORDEAL together. They promise each other they
wont tell Marsellus what happened. You get the feeling that if anything ever happened to Marsellus Wallace, these two would probably
get together.
BUTCH’S STORY
The story now switches to another thread, the Hero’s Journey of
Butch, the boxer. It takes us back to Butch’s early ORDINARY
WORLD, a scene from his childhood in suburbia, where he watches
a Speed Racer cartoon on TV in 1972.
A CALL TO ADVENTURE is issued by a HERALD or MENTOR, Captain Koons, the Air Force officer who brings the gold watch
318
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
that belonged to his father and forefathers. In a long monologue
Koons describes the watch’s tradition of being carried by American soldiers in Butch’s family. He relates the ORDEAL that he and
Butch’s father endured in the Vietnamese prison camp. The watch
becomes an emblem of manly tradition that connects it to symbols
like the magic swords that heroes inherited from their fathers. However, we're brought crashing back to reality with the earthy detail of
where Butch’s father hid the watch for five years, and Captain Koons
used a similar hiding place for two years after Butch’s father died. Fulfilling the DONOR function of a MENTOR, the officer gives the
watch to Butch.
We're then thrown back to the present where we see Butch getting another CALL — this time his manager calling him into the ring
for the fight he’s supposed to throw.
“THE GOLD WATCH”
A title card now makes it clear we are taking up a major thread of
another Hero's Journey. We find out, through the radio that plays in
the taxicab outside, that instead of throwing the fight as agreed with
Marsellus, Butch has won the fight and killed the other boxer. He has
refused Marsellus’s CALL, but has answered other calls — the CALL
of his own spirit to fight well, and the CALL of temptation to cheat
Marsellus and collect a lot of money.
Butch CROSSES A THRESHOLD as he leaps from a window into a dumpster. He boards the cab and begins stripping off the
attributes of a prizefighter, leaving this part of his life behind. In a
TESTS, ALLIES, ENEMIES scene, his attitude is probed through
his conversation with Esmerelda Villalobos, the woman cabdriver
from Colombia. She explains her name has a beautiful, poetic meaning (“Esmerelda of the Wolves”), and Butch says his name, like most
American names, doesn’t mean anything. Again the note of cultural
relativity is sounded. She is morbidly curious about what it feels
319
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
like to kill a man. Instead of horrifying her, it seems to turn her on.
Everything is relative. Butch himself offers a rationalization for having killed the other boxer. If he was a better fighter, he'd be alive. He
makes an ALLY of her and wins her promise to tell the police she
never saw him.
By his actions he has made ENEMIES of Marsellus Wallace and
his crew. We see Marsellus sending his minions to hunt down Butch,
all the way to Indo-China if necessary.
In an APPROACH phase, Butch makes a phone call to check on
his winnings. He goes to his French girlfriend, Fabienne, at a motel
and they make plans to skip the country once he’s collected his money.
Their flirtatious talk, characteristic of intimate APPROACH scenes,
seems to be more of the seemingly banal chatter that marks the early
scenes between Vincent and Jules. It has the same sense of cultural
relativity and differing value systems. Here the distinctions are along
gender lines, as the girlfriend tries to make Butch understand her
precise attitude about potbellies on women. They make love and the
night ends with a false sense that all will be well.
A new and immediate CALL TO ADVENTURE is sounded
the next morning as Butch discovers Fabienne has failed to retrieve his
father’s watch from his apartment. Without consulting any Mentors,
he overcomes his fear of being caught by Marsellus and goes to get the
watch. Driving to his apartment, he is CROSSING THE THRESHOLD into a SPECIAL WORLD of increased danger.
After a careful APPROACH to his apartment, Butch takes
possession of the watch, SEIZING THE SWORD. However, he
encounters a THRESHOLD GUARDIAN sent by Marsellus to
kill him. It’s Vincent, who has been reading a book in the bathroom (the comic spy thriller Modesty Blaise by Peter O'Donnell).
Foolishly, in a fatal, tragic mistake, Vincent has underestimated
his opponent, and has left his gun sitting on the kitchen counter.
Butch hears the toilet flush, grabs the gun, and kills Vincent. It’s a
320
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
near-death ORDEAL for Butch, but it’s the tragic CLIMAX for
Vincent, who has been brought down by one of his flaws — his disrespect for his elders. He is punished with true poetic justice, and in
a humiliating way, being caught gunless while exiting the toilet. We
don’t know it yet, but Vincent also appears to be paying the price
for having denied a miracle — the miracle of escaping the bullets of
the Fourth Young Man in the earlier scene. His death at this point
seems like divine punishment for having refused to acknowledge
divine intervention.
With the REWARD of the watch in his pocket, Butch hits THE
ROAD BACK, trying to get to his girlfriend. On the way, he literally
runs into his SHADOW, Marsellus, ramming him with the car when
he sees Marsellus crossing the street. However, Butch is also injured
and dazed when his car collides with another car, a quick REVERSAL. Marsellus, appearing dead to a bystander, comes back to life
(RESURRECTION) and staggers towards Butch with a gun.
Butch wobbles into the “Mason-Dixon Pawn Shop” and Marsellus follows him (a CHASE typical of THE ROAD BACK). Butch
punches Marsellus and is about to kill him when he’s stopped by the
gun shop owner, Maynard, who is armed with a shotgun.
Butch and Marsellus don’t realize they’ve stumbled into an
INMOST CAVE more sinister than anything they have encountered, an underworld beneath the underworld in which they live.
Maynard knocks out Butch and summons his brother Zed, like him,
a SHADOW projection of the worst aspects of white American male
culture. Marsellus and Butch wake up, chained and gagged with S&M
gear, in the still deeper cave of the dungeon beneath the store.
Zed brings up a leather-clad creature, The Gimp, from a still
deeper pit beneath the floor. Whether he is their retarded brother
or a poor victim driven mad by their torture, The Gimp suggests the
horrors that await Marsellus and Butch. Marsellus is chosen to be the
first victim of the evil brothers’ sadistic attention, and is taken into
o21

a room once occupied by another victim, Russell. There is a sense in
this adventure that others have gone before and have not won their
round with death.
Butch hears the two brothers raping Marsellus, a terrible
ORDEAL that brings death to Marsellus’s manhood. (In these scenes,
again, is a sense of relativity. No matter how harshly we may have
judged Marsellus and Butch for their behavior, there are still worse
villains and lower circles of hell. Marsellus and Butch look like villains or SHADOWS from society’s point of view, but compared to
the denizens of the gun shop they are HEROES.)
Butch sees an opportunity and escapes, punching out The Gimp,
who falls limp and hangs himself on his leash. Butch escapes upstairs
and actually has his hand on the door, ready to leave, but has a crisis
of conscience. He decides to make a true hero’s SACRIFICE, risking his life by returning to rescue Marsellus, even though he knows
Marsellus wants to kill him for not throwing the fight. He selects a
samurai sword from the many weapons at hand (literally SEIZING
THE SWORD), and descends once again into the INMOST CAVE
for his ultimate ORDEAL.
Butch kills Maynard, and Marsellus grabs a shotgun, shooting
Zed in the groin. Marsellus is free, having rebounded from almost
certain death, a RESURRECTION. Butch’s heroic action balances
the moral books for Butch’s killing of the other boxer. Marsellus is
TRANSFORMED by the experience, and grants a BOON to Butch,
sparing his life and allowing him to escape so long as he promises not
to tell anyone what happened, and to stay away from Los Angeles.
Then he calls upon a MENTOR, Mr. Wolf, for help in cleaning up
the situation.
Butch SEIZES A SWORD, so to speak, taking the motorcycle that belonged to one of the monstrous bikers. On this steed the
hero takes THE ROAD BACK to collect his fair lady. Although he
may not be able to collect the ELIXIR of the gambling money, the
522
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
hero has been rewarded with a greater ELIXIR of life. He rides off
with Fabienne on the motorcycle, which bears the significant name
of “Grace, an ELIXIR granted to those who make the right moral
choices on the Hero’s Journey.
“THE BONNIE SITUATION”
Now the thread of Vincent and Jules is picked up again at the moment
when Jules recites his Bible passage in the apartment of the Young
Men, and we hear the scripture for a second time. The Young Man
bursts out shooting at them, clearly a death-dealing ORDEAL. By
rights they should be dead, but somehow they survive and the bullets
pock the wall all around them.
The two young men react quite differently to their brush with
death. Vincent dismisses it as a lucky break or coincidence, but Jules
has an APOTHEOSIS. He is deeply moved and recognizes it as a
miracle, an act of God, a sign which requires a change in attitude.
Their reaction is a kind of TEST, one which Vincent appears to fail
and Jules appears to pass with flying colors. Jules wins a REWARD
from the experience, a greater spiritual awareness, but Vincent gets
nothing out of it.
(The fact that we have already seen Butch kill Vincent makes this
scene a kind of RESURRECTION for Vincent; we have seen him
die, but now we see him alive again. This is another manifestation of
the fractured postmodern time sense, which says the notion of linear
time is an arbitrary convention.)
On the ROAD BACK from this death-and-rebirth moment,
Vincent makes a deadly error, again due to his flaw of lack of respect.
He has insufficient respect for the tools of death, and waving the gun
around in the car, accidentally puts a bullet through the head of their
accomplice Marvin in the backseat.
Jules recognizes that this must be cleaned up and drives to the
house of his friend and ALLY, Jimmie Dimmick, played by Quentin
323
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Tarantino. He appears to be a middle-class fellow whose connection
to the criminal world is never specified. He is worried about the moral
wrath of his wife, Bonnie, who will soon be returning home from the
night shift. (Here the filmmaker is creating contrast between the criminal underworld and the bourgeois world in which most of us live. The
joke is that they are more afraid of Bonnie’s irritation than of the danger of the law coming down on them for manslaughter.)
Jules and Vincent try to clean themselves up, but are only partially successful. Jules scolds Vincent for getting blood all over the
guest towels, another sign that Vincent is careless and disrespectful,
traits which we know will get him killed. He is in danger of turning
another ALLY, Jimmie, into an ENEMY.
Jules calls Marsellus for help, and he in turn summons a MENTOR and ALLY in the form of Winston Wolf, played by Harvey
Keitel. His name links him with Esmerelda Villalobos, Esmerelda of
the Wolves, an Ally in another thread of the story. They fulfill some of
the same functions performed by Animal Helpers in many folktales.
Wolf appears to be a specialist in problem solving, experienced
at getting rid of inconvenient evidence. He arrives at supernatural
speed and takes charge of the problem, issuing orders authoritatively.
However, once again Vincent is disrespectful of his elders, and balks
at being ordered around. Wolf handles it with humor but also unquestionable authority, making it clear that Vincent should not make an
ENEMY of his ALLY.
Wolf supervises as Vincent and Jules cleanse the bloody car.
The whole sequence is a protracted RESURRECTION for the
young men, in which they and their vehicle are purified before the
RETURN. Meanwhile Jimmie must make a SACRIFICE, surrendering sheets and towels for the clean-up, but Wolf promptly
compensates him with a REWARD of money for new furniture.
‘Then, acting precisely like a shaman putting warriors through a
cleansing ordeal of RESURRECTION, Wolf orders Vincent and
324
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
Jules to strip off their bloody clothes. He makes Jimmie hose them
down with icy water as they soap themselves clean of the blood. Next
Jimmie issues them new clothing, significantly, boyish shorts and
T-shirts. They look like schoolboys or college kids instead of tough
gangsters. Like returning hunters, they have been put through a deathand-rebirth ritual that makes them innocent children again. Now
they can re-enter the ORDINARY WORLD cleansed of the death
they have faced and dealt with. Throughout, they have hung onto the
mysterious briefcase, an ELLXIR which they brought back from the
ORDEAL in the yuppie apartment.
Wolf escorts them to an auto graveyard where the body and the
car will be disposed of. He says farewell and goes off with his young
girlfriend Raquel, daughter of the junkyard owner, showing how
an experienced Mentor enjoys his ELIXIR, won through “correct”
behavior by the rules of this movie’s universe. He compliments Jules
for showing respect to his elders, a sign of character.
CEPILOGUE*
Finally, the narrative returns to the original scene in the diner for the
epilogue, the last word on the subject. While Pumpkin and Honey
Bunny plan their stickup, Jules and Vincent review what has happened. Vincent, typically, tries to dismiss it, but Jules insists they have
seen a miracle today. He resolves to live his life differently from now
on, “walking the Earth” like Cain in the TV series “Kung Fu.” This
seems to mean wandering about doing good and seeking peace rather
than living a criminal life. He has truly been through a moral RESURRECTION and transformation. Vincent doesn’t value any of this
and gets up to go to the bathroom, the same action that ultimately
gets him killed.
As a final TEST of Jules’s resolve, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny
start screaming and waving their guns around. Pumpkin tries to seize
the ELIXIR of the mystery briefcase, opening it and falling under its
B2D
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
spell, but Jules gets the drop on him. (Pumpkin’s attempt echoes the
fairy-tale motif of the False Claimant, who appears just as the hero is
ready to claim his reward.)
Jules talks calmly but intensely to Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.
He makes a deal with Pumpkin, giving him money from his wallet in
return for leaving the briefcase alone. It’s a final moment in which we
are balanced between life and death. Jules recites his Bible passage for
a third time, although on this reading it has a totally different meaning for him. Where before he identified with the wrathful face of God,
dealing death to the unrighteous, now he identifies with the hand of
mercy and justice, trying to be the blessed one “who, in the name of
charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness.” He has moved his center from thoughtless killing to a new level
of heroic action, from which he can use his warrior skills for good. He
is able to defuse the potentially deadly situation and walks away with
the ELIXIR in hand. ASHOWDOWN which would normally leave
at least one person dead has been handled with finesse and grace worthy of Mr. Wolf. Jules has grown from being a SHADOW, a ruthless
killer, to being a true HERO. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny walk away
with the ELIXIR of their lives, which they won by making the right
decision and keeping cool under Jules’s orders. If they are smart, they
will move up the ladder of souls and prepare for adventures on the
level of Jules and Vincent.
Vincent and Jules walk away with the ELIXIR-filled briefcase.
The tale is “over,” although we know that in linear time, there is still
much of the story ahead. Vincent and Jules will now deliver the briefcase to Marsellus at the bar, Vincent will show disrespect for Butch
and will undergo his ORDEAL with Mia, Butch will not throw
the fight and will kill Vincent before surviving his ORDEAL with
Marsellus. The real ending, if these events are rearranged in linear
sequence, is the moment when Butch and his girlfriend ride off on
the motorcycle.
326
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
The theme of Pulp Fiction seems to be the testing of men by
ordeals. Different characters react differently to their respective confrontations with Death. Despite the relativistic tone of the film, the
storytellers do seem to have a moral point of view. They sit in God’s
chair, dealing out the punishment of death for Vincent, who offends
against the moral code of the movie, and rewarding Jules and Butch
with life for making the right choices in the scheme of the film. In
this the filmmakers, despite the appearance of unconventionality, ate
quite conventional, following a moral code as strict as that in a John
Ford or Alfred Hitchcock movie.
The most interesting case is that of Vincent, who faces ordeals in
two completely different arenas, with different results. In the arena of
love and loyalty, on his date with Mia, he behaves with chivalry and
courage, like a knight of old, and for this he is rewarded by brief survival. But in the arena of respect for Higher Powers and for his more
experienced elders, he fails, and is swiftly punished. Once again a relativistic note is sounded, suggesting that mastery over one area of life
doesn’t necessarily mean mastery of all aspects.
The interwoven Hero’s Journeys of Vincent, Jules, and Butch
present a full spectrum of heroic possibilities, encompassing the
dramatic, the tragic, the comic, and the transcendent. Like Joseph
Campbell’s definition of myth, Pulp Fiction is a “shapeshifting yet marvelously constant story... with a challengingly persistent suggestion
of more remaining to be experienced than will ever be known or told.”
HERO’S JOURNEYS IN THE SHAPE OF WATER
The Shape of Water was critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and showered with awards, including thirteen Oscars© for its
director, writers, cast, and crew. Director Guillermo Del Toro and
his cowriter Vanessa Taylor crafted this mix of fairytale, fable, and
horror in the spirit of magic realism, presenting us with a richly
detailed and believable world pierced by something strange and
327
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
otherworldly. As in Del Toro’s previous works such as Pan's Labyrinth and Hell-Boy, the monster might look strange and scary but
turns out to be wonderfully human and relatable, leaving the horror to be provided by ordinary humans who are monstrous enough
in their greed, lust, and cruelty.
The movie is formally composed with a sense of poetry that
employs abundant metaphors and symbols. Eggs recur in different
ways to suggest the latent potential in Elisa, the mute cleaning woman
who tries to save a monster. Water is everywhere, dripping, flowing,
seeping, boiling, a medium that connects Elisa to her beloved Creature. Every color and composition, every element of the plot, every
character detail and note of the music is thoughtfully considered to
make a coherent design. With voiceovers from the sensitive artist
Giles bookending the narrative, Del Toro signals that the movie is
Giles’s reverie, something like a moving painting that may not be literally true but that captures an impression of his memories of Elisa.
The Shape of Water is suffused with Del Toro’s love of the moyies. Elisa and her gay neighbor Giles share a love for old musicals, and
their apartments are located above a movie theatre that plays a Biblical
epic. In a Hero’s Journey Reward moment in the second act, a wistful, whimsical fantasy sequence turns into a full-blown movie musical
number in which Elisa and the Creature dance like Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers. But another movie reference is always swimming
in the dimly lit depths, The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)
and its sequels, Revenge of the Creature (’55) and The Creature Walks
Among Us (56).
They were humble “B” movies, but they had a special resonance
in my childhood (and Del Toro’s) when they were new. Universal’s
iconic character, the Gill-Man, evoked an enjoyable mixture of emotions, much like his predecessor, Frankenstein’s Monster. On one hand
I was delightfully horrified by Gill-Man’s power and strangeness, his
huge, staring eyes, his scaly skin. On the other I felt sympathy for this
328
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
lonely being, probably the last of his prehistoric kind. Though he
killed those who encroached on his realm, he was not a total brute,
and could appreciate beauty, unforgettably swimming just below an
unsuspecting damsel in a bathing suit, yearning to caress her legs with
his webbed claws. I must have been five when I saw the first movie at
the drive-in and somehow the Gill-Man came home with me in the
car, a huge, wordless presence, a new monster to swim in my unconscious. He haunted my dreams and lurked in the hallway when I had
to get up to answer the call of nature in the middle of the night. His
strangeness made me shudder with dread but at the same time I felt
reassured by him.
The Creature from the Black Lagoon made an impression on Del
Toro, too, who has said that when he saw the movie in his childhood,
he sympathized with the Gill-Man and was gravely disappointed that
he didn’t get the girl. He had an “almost existential desire for them to
end up together.” Later in life, as an accomplished filmmaker, he was
in talks with Universal studio executives about directing a Creature
from the Black Lagoon remake, but they couldn’t agree on his creaturecentered rethinking of the franchise, and so Del Toro left the project.
The Shape of Water is quite a different story from that of The Creature from the Black Lagoon but it shares some of its DNA. It’s not a
copy of the Creature movies, but a kind of answer to them, a reconsideration of the feelings and wishes that they stirred up in a young
movie-watcher’s imagination.
OPENING IMAGE anp PROLOGUE
From the first frame we are already swimming in the unconscious, in
a watery space where bubbles dance and intertwine. In a voiceover,
the narrator, GILES (Richard Jenkins), gives us the story’s dreamy
prologue, framing it as a fairytale about a silent princess, a tale of love
and loss, and of a monster who tried to destroy it all. We glide into
an underwater room where everyday objects, table, chairs, and clock,
329
THE WRITER'S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
are floating in a graceful dance. Our hero ELISA (Sally Hawkins), a
sleeping beauty, floats through this surreal space in a nightgown and
sleep mask. The watery element vanishes, the objects and Elisa settle
down to their places, and the alarm clock rings, waking Elisa from
her watery dream.
THE ORDINARY WORLD
Elisa performs her daily ritual, preparing to work the night shift in a
Baltimore government facility circa 1962. She boils eggs for her lunch,
takes off her robe, and indulges herself in the watery embrace of her
tub. It is an intimate introduction to our story’s hero. Every object
seems to be rendered in tasteful tones of green; this is the curated fantasy of a sensitive artist. Everything is connected in a net of poetry.
The bubbles in the opening shot rhyme with the bubbles in the water
she boils for her eggs. The eggs rhyme with the egg-shaped timer that
limits her sensual pleasure in the bath, and both foreshadow the gift
of eggs that will connect Elisa and the Amphibian Man.
Elisa’s character is deftly sketched with details of daily behavior.
We can see that she takes pride in her footwear and has a nice collection of shoes expressing her personality. She is a creature of routines and
rituals, measuring her time and tasks precisely, checking a calendar that
offers a daily inspirational thought. In a mirror she studies parallel scars
on her neck, a visible expression of the WOUNDS that all heroes bear.
Dressed in muted shades of green, Elisa crosses the hall for a
brief visit with her friend Giles, a gay artist who lives next door. He
is a loyal ALLY for Elisa but is on his own Hero’s Journey, facing the
end of his career as a commercial artist and the alarming approach of
old age. We learn that he loves sharing old movie musicals with Elisa.
They both live above an aging movie theatre that is playing a Biblical
movie about the Old Testament figure Ruth.
Elisa rides a bus to work, alone and thoughtful. She arrives
at a secret government facility where she works as a cleaner on
330
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
the midnight shift with her earthy and protective friend ZELDA
(Octavia Spencer), another ALLY, who, like Giles, can read Elisa’s
sign language.
CALL TO ADVENTURE
There is a stir in the facility as a new “Asset” is wheeled into a laboratory in an elaborate sealed container. Elisa and Zelda are told to clean
up around the container. Elisa is fascinated by strange noises coming
from inside.
The Asset, a gilled AMPHIBIAN MAN (Doug Jones) from
South America, is being studied by a thoughtful scientist, Dr. HOFFSTETLER (Michael Stuhlbarg), but its fate is in the hands of a cruel
government agent, STRICKLAND (Michael Shannon), who has
already clashed with the creature while retrieving it and only wants
to see it suffer before it dies.
After work, Elisa joins Giles at a diner where he likes to order
green-tinted key lime pie, really an excuse to try for a connection with
the handsome young man who works at the counter. Back at home,
Giles retreats from stressful news reports of racial strife on the TV,
preferring to live in an earlier age of dreamy, lighthearted musicals.
To the old tune of “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze,”
we see Elisa repeating her daily routine but in quick time, suggesting
it is becoming a repetitive treadmill.
Back at the lab, Hoffstetler’s archetypal function is not revealed
just yet, but Strickland is clearly a SHADOW, drawn in the darkest
shades of villainy. In a classic “villain’s reconnaissance” he barges into
a restroom where Zelda and Elisa are cleaning, urinates disrespectfully in their presence, and brags crudely about a penis-like electric
cattle prod that he uses to torture the creature. When he leaves, they
hear the pitiful moaning of the creature, a sound that Elisa hears in
her heart asa CALL TO ADVENTURE.
331
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Elisa and Zelda are summoned urgently to clean up a mess of
blood in the lab where Amphibian Man has bitten off two of Strickland’s fingers. Elisa finds the missing digits and (offscreen) they are
surgically reattached to Strickland’s hand, though they become badly
infected. Like the infirmities of many fairytale and film noir Shadow
figures, his mutilated fingers become a symbol of his inner corruption.
At home, Elisa excitedly tells Giles about getting a glimpse of
the creature, but he is preoccupied with his own drama which seems
to be heading to a tragedy of uselessness and old age. He wears a wig
in a sad attempt to look younger and bemoans his aging face. His
career as a commercial artist is nearly at an end, and though he pins
his hopes on pleasing his last client, his lyrical style of painted illustration is being crowded out by crass, literal photography. Like Elisa,
he stands at a threshold.
THRESHOLD CROSSING
Elisa CROSSES A THRESHOLD the next evening when she finds
a moment alone with Amphibian Man in the lab. Something, perhaps a feeling of afhnity with this lonely, speechless being, moves her
to reach out with the gift of a boiled egg that she peels and offers to
him. She feels some fear when he shows his full form — tall, strange,
and alarming — but soon moves past the fear to appreciate his beauty
and majesty. In this and following scenes, they bond into an alliance,
romantically linked as the dual heroes of the story. However, the creature’s combination of frightening wildness and gentle grace makes
him a SHAPESHIFTER to Elisa's hero, a catalyst to awaken the possibilities within her.
TESTS; ALEIES ENEMIES
Strickland does a routine but menacing interrogation of Elisa and Zelda,
warning them to stay well away from the creature which he sees as a
thing of pure evil that should be destroyed. He asks what Elisa’s last
Sy
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
name, Esposito, means. No one answers, but in Latin American countries it means “orphan” or one who is exposed, that is, left out in the
elements as a baby near an orphanage. All that is known of her birth is
that someone cruelly slashed her vocal cords and then abandoned her.
Elisa's bus ride home is illuminated by the rising sun, symbolizing
the dawning of new life possibilities in her.
The same sun shines on Strickland as he returns home to his tooperfect 1960s wife and children. His wife is lusty, summoning him
to the bedroom. His encounter with Elisa has awakened a sadistic
impulse in him. Her speechlessness is somehow arousing to him, and
he projects it into brutal sex with his wife, mufHling her cries to mimic
Elisa’s silence.
Elisa decides to go deeper in her relationship with Amphibian
Man by smuggling in a portable record player that fascinates him.
They share a meal of eggs and study each other. At home, she picks
out records to play for him and dances in the hall, delighted to be in
love. At work, the changes in her are noted by Zelda and by Dr. Hoffstetler, who watches from the shadows.
APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE
Hoffstetler shares Elisa’s sense that the creature is a miracle of nature,
but he is revealed to be a Russian secret agent, sent to monitor the
creature in case it turns out to have strategic value. He meets in secret
with his handler MIHALKOV (Nigel Bennett), a crude bureaucrat
who does not appreciate the scientific wonder of the creature. He
makes it clear that Hoffstetler may have to kill it to keep the Americans from profiting by any strategic discoveries about it. At this point
Hoffstetler is a SHAPESHIFTER who oscillates between being an
ALLY and a SHADOW or threat for Elisa and the creature.
Meanwhile, pressure increases on Strickland when his boss,
stern GENERAL HOYT (Nick Searcy), visits the lab. We learn that
Amphibian Man was revered as a god by the local people where he
333
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
was discovered. Hoyt wants results from studies of the creature, but
Strickland argues strongly for killing the thing and dissecting it to
learn its secrets. General Hoyt decrees the creature will live for now
but asserts his right to order its destruction at any moment.
At home, Elisa frantically pleads with Giles to help her free the
creature, making a CALL TO ADVENTURE in his Hero's Journey.
In a clear REFUSAL OF THE CALL, Giles turns his back on her,
going off with his just-completed painting to deliver it to his client,
his last hope of reviving his career. It comes to nothing; the client
rejects his work without even looking at it and closes the door on any
future work.
In desperation Giles gathers his courage to talk to the attractive
young man in the coffeeshop, but the gates of hope are shut here too,
as the young man reveals himself to be both a homophobe and a racist who refuses to serve a black couple.
Feeling he has nothing to lose, Giles CROSSES A THRESHOLD and agrees to help Elisa free Amphibian Man, forging an ID
card with his artist’s skills and painting a van to look like a laundry
vehicle (APPROACH). He’s proud of her for carefully planning the
rescue and being fearless, though she admits she feels fear too. The
plan is for Elisa to disable the security cameras for a few minutes
while she smuggles the creature into the laundry van, to be driven
away by Giles.
The threat of death intensifies as Mihalkov supplies Dr. Hoffstetler with a device to blow out the lab’s power and lighting, along
with a syringe of powerful poison to kill Amphibian Man.
As pressure increases on our heroes, Strickland seems on top of
the world as he impulsively treats himself to a brand-new teal Cadillac that he drives away with pride. At work he concocts a reason to
get Elisa into his office, where he makes crude advances towards her,
trying to caress her neck scars. She runs away from his creepy touch,
aware he will not be held off for long.
334
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
ORDEAL
Elisa launches her plan, teetering suspensefully on some chemical
drums as she turns the cameras away from the loading dock. Her
movements are noticed by Dr. Hoffstetler, who realizes she is trying
to save the creature. He transforms into an ALLY and a MENTOR,
giving her Mentor gifts: the key to Amphibian Man’s collar and
instructions on how to keep him alive in saltwater.
Giles is having a hero’s ORDEAL in the van, stopped by a
suspicious SECURITY GUARD who is threatening to kill him.
Fortunately, Dr. Hoffstetler is able to kill the guard with the poison
intended for the creature and helps Giles and Elisa by knocking out
the lab’s lighting system. Elisa is moving Amphibian Man in a laundry
basket on wheels but is unexpectedly stopped by Zelda who acts as a
THRESHOLD GUARDIAN for a few moments, blocking her path
and opposing her plan. But, seeing that Dr. Hoftstetler supports the
rescue, Zelda decides to help Elisa, becoming an ALLY again, though
she worries about the danger they are in.
Giles drives off with Elisa and the creature, accidentally crashing
into Strickland’s new Cadillac while Strickland fires his pistol uselessly at the retreating van. He doesn’t realize it was Elisa’s doing and
assumes it was the work of a crack Russian spy team. He’s furious but
also terrified of being seen as a failure by his boss and father figure,
General Hoyt, who threatens to destroy his career if he doesn’t recover
Amphibian Man quickly.
Elisa has installed the creature in her bathtub and faces a CRISIS and ORDEAL as it gasps, near death, until she remembers Dr.
Hoffstetler’s advice to keep him in saltwater. She rushes frantically
to get salt from the cupboard to mix into the tub water. In a classic
death-and-rebirth tableau, Amphibian Man seems to have died for a
moment but revives to the relief of Elisa and Giles, who have a good
REWARD of laughter for having survived the Ordeal.
335
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Elisa stocks up on salt and buys a corny friendship card for the
creature as their bond strengthens. She plans to release him into a
canal that connects to the sea when the October rains fill the channel, in a few days. Time is precious.
While Elisa is at work, Giles keeps company with Amphibian
Man, telling of his loneliness and feeling of being out of synch with
his times. The creature seems to empathize. However, when Giles
falls asleep, Amphibian Man rises from the water to walk around
the apartment, exploring. Seeing one of Giles’s cats hissing at him,
the creature hisses back and bites its head off. Giles is wakened by its
dying screech and yells at Amphibian Man, who runs from the apartment in fear, scratching Giles’s arm as he passes, another near-death
ORDEAL for Giles.
Meanwhile, Elisa and Zelda are being questioned again by an
increasingly suspicious Strickland but maintain they saw nothing
unusual the night of the creature’s kidnapping. Later, Dr. Hoffstetler secretly approaches Zelda and Elisa, wanting assurance that
Amphibian Man is all right, and urging them to release him soon.
Elisa signs that Dr. Hoffstetler is a good man, and he reveals, with
Old World politeness, that his name is Dmitri and he is honored
to meet them.
Summoned by an urgent call from Giles, Elisa goes looking for
the missing creature, and following a trail of his bloody claw prints,
she finds him inside the theatre, gazing in wonder at the Biblical epic unfolding on the screen. She embraces him and leads him
back upstairs.
REWARD
Amphibian Man makes peace with Giles, touching his scalp and arm
wound in some kind of blessing. In an intimate moment with Elisa
in the bath, the creature curiously touches the scars on her neck, and
she runs away frightened. She prepares for bed, putting on her sleep
336
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
mask, but changes her mind and goes to join Amphibian Man, removing her clothes, stepping into the tub, and pulling the curtain so we
are left to imagine their embrace.
Going to work that evening, Elisa is in a sensual daze, hypnotized
by wind-driven water droplets on her window, especially two drops
that dance and merge together. At work, Elisa’s smiles alert the perceptive Zelda that something has happened with the Gill-Man, and
Elisa shares some intimate details about his anatomy.
Dr. Hoffstetler is under pressure from both a suspicious Strickland and his handler Mihalkov who warns he must be ready to be
extracted very soon when the creature has been killed. He pretends
to have killed the creature and claims to have disposed of its body, but
Mihalkov doesn’t trust him.
At home with Amphibian Man, Elisa gets the idea to seal the
bathroom door with towels so she can flood the room and have a
sexy swim with her fish-man. The fun ends when the theatre owner
complains that water is leaking from his ceiling, and Giles opens the
bathroom door to be knocked down by a flood of water.
Giles has realized Amphibian Man has godlike powers, because his
arm wound has healed and thick, youthful hair is sprouting on his head
where the thing touched him. He is literally transformed and rejuvenated as REWARD for surviving a hero’s ordeal. However, the creature
seems to be in decline, and they realize they must release it soon.
Inevitably, the day marked on the calendar comes, and Elisa
sits sadly with Amphibian Man. In a fantasy sequence she is able to
sing to him, “You'll never know how much I love you,” and in a lush
Hollywood black-and-white production number they dance ecstatically together.
THE ROAD BACK
Strickland launches into a furious PURSUIT of Amphibian Man. He
is sure Dr. Hoffstetler conspired to save the creature and follows him
337
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
to a cement plant where Hoffstetler is shot on Mihalkov’s orders for
failing to destroy the creature. Strickland arrives and kills Mihalkov
and his henchman, then brutally tortures the dying Hoffstetler to find
out that it was the lowly women cleaners who were behind the rescue.
Strickland crashes into Zelda’s apartment looking for Amphibian
Man. Zelda's spineless HUSBAND reveals it is with Elisa. Zelda manages to warn Elisa who gets away with the creature and Giles before
Strickland arrives at their apartments. However, Strickland follows a
clue from the calendar page and arrives near the canal just as Elisa is
saying a bittersweet goodbye to Amphibian Man.
RESURRECTION
Strickland knocks down Giles and shoots Elisa and the creature with
his pistol. Giles recovers (RESURRECTION) and smacks Strickland’s head with a piece of timber. Amphibian Man uses his power
to heal himself. The bloodied Strickland sees this and has an EPIPHANY, realizing “You really are a god” before the creature slashes his
throat with its claw.
RETURN WITH ELIXIR
Amphibian Man gives Giles a last blessing and receives a kind touch
in return. Cradling the dying Elisa in his arms, the creature dives into
the canal and swims around her drifting body through greenish shafts
of light. Giles, in voiceover, tells us that he believed they lived on
together and loved each other, and in confirmation we see Amphibian
Man healing Elisa’s bullet wound and caressing her neck scars, causing
them to transform into gills (REBIRTH, ELIXIR). She gasps, startled
awake, but is soon able to breathe, and they swirl together in the shafts
of green light. Giles completes the design (ELIXIR) with a poem
written long ago: “Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all
around me. Your presence fills my eyes with your love. It humbles my
338
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
heart for you are everywhere.” (Apparently a paraphrase of lines by
the 12th century Sufi mystic Hakim Sanai.)
The Shape of Water is painterly, majestic, lyrical, and super-dramatized, creating a highly polarized world where villains are really, really
bad and the good guys are really, really good. In a deft, confident,
sometimes humorous way, Del Toro uses symbols to form connective
tissues that bind the work into a coherent design. He turns eggs into
a symbol of the latent life inside Elisa. In the image of the egg timer
shaped like an egg, he combines the fertility possibilities of eggs with
the relentless progress of time. We are reminded that the clock of life
is always ticking. Elisa has a short time to connect with the creature,
the brief window of five minutes to pull off the liberation of the creature from the lab and only a few days to enjoy her love affair with
Amphibian Man before he must be released back into nature. Giles
himself is a reminder of the passage of time, warning Elisa not to end
up like him, alone and frustrated.
The egg symbol, like many things in the movie, is polarized, at
times being a benevolent device that connects Elisa and Amphibian
Man and elsewhere being a dangerous thing that makes Strickland
suspicious of Elisa when he finds eggs she has brought for the creature. Characters are strongly polarized as well. Allies like Giles and
Zelda who have encouraged and guided her turn briefly into fierce
Threshold Guardians barring her way. Dr. Hoffstetler is an elaborate Shapeshifter, first appearing to be a Shadow who threatens the
creature, then turning out to be a most helpful Ally who aids in the
escape and even serves as a Mentor by giving Elisa the secrets of keeping Amphibian Man alive.
At first glance the movie might seem to be a simple fairytale version of a Hero’s Journey, but it actually offers subtle variations on the
standard pattern and masterful handling of the archetypes, applying
them lightly and with great flexibility.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
WHO IS THE HERO?
The movie takes an unorthodox but effective approach to the Hero's
Journey by distributing the attributes of hero among the major characters, including the villain. Viewers have a lot of choice about where
to invest their feelings. Elisa takes the lead position as the driving force
in the drama; it is her love story and her choice to risk everything by
rescuing the creature. But Giles undertakes his own complete Hero's
Journey, in some ways more complex and fully developed than Elisa's.
After spending a long time pursuing his own failed quests to recover
his youth, and after elaborately Refusing the Call to join Elisa’s adventure, Giles finally Crosses a Threshold by agreeing to help her, faces
death in a physical Ordeal and wins a Reward of renewed vitality and
youth. At the end he survives another Resurrection encounter with
death and delivers for us the Elixir of his return to life, his memories
of Elisa and her creature, and his belief that their love transcends space
and time, shapeless as water but living on everywhere.
It’s not surprising that Elisa and Giles share so many of the Hero’s
functions, since Del Toro has said that he conceived of the two characters as a single entity. He designed their living spaces as if one great
room had been divided long ago to make two apartments, almost
like lobes of the same brain. Nevertheless, they have distinct styles as
Heroes. Elisa is of the committed, eager tribe of Heroes and registers
no Refusal of the Call, but Giles more than makes up for it by refusing to join her adventure team at first and by denying the facts of his
advancing age. Elisa has no discernable flaws to overcome, except
that she is impulsive; Giles is full of flaws — cowardly, painfully shy,
self-deluding, and vain — that make him in some ways a more wellrounded and appealing Hero.
Zelda is clearly an Ally for Elisa, and briefly turns into a Threshold Guardian, but her journey is also heroic, causing her to risk her
personal safety to help another being. We don’t know how her Hero’s
Journey ends; one hopes that any threat to her died with Strickland
340
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
and that she will not end up in federal prison for breaking secrecy
laws. There will certainly be a reckoning with her cowardly husband
who told Strickland where to find the creature.
Dr. Hoffstetler is another character who shares the Hero mantle
in this tale. In his own Journey he is a Hero torn between his duty as
a spy and his scientific awe for Amphibian Man, but this is concealed
from the audience at first, and he temporarily serves as a Shapeshifter
used to create a sense of mystery and intrigue swirling around the creature. In a series of reveals we learn that he is a Russian spy tasked to kill
the fish-man, but that his true and noble nature as a scientist demands
that he help Elisa set the creature free. He makes the essential heroic
choice, risking his personal safety to help other beings. Unfortunately,
his thread of the Journey ends in tragedy and he goes down as a sacrificial victim to the needs of the story. However, his death serves a
story purpose, showing how ruthless Strickland is and how he might
treat Elisa and Amphibian Man if he catches them.
Del Toro even makes room in his design for a Hero’s Journey for
Strickland, the movie’s Shadow. He is the clear villain of the piece but
a pure and justified Hero in his own mind. Del Toro has said he shared
the idea with the actor Michael Shannon that if the movie had been
made in the middle of the twentieth century, Strickland would have
been the hero. Del Toro took pains to dress the character in an immaculate suit and tie that could have been worn by Cary Grant at his
most heroic. From Strickland’s point of view, this is a monster movie
in which he is the anointed savior of humanity from a hellish abomination. His bitten-off and poorly reattached fingers could be seen as
the wounds of a Hero as well as signs of corruption in a Shadow. If he
is the Hero of his own movie, it is a tragedy in which he sacrifices his
life in a vain attempt to save society from a creature he sees as a threat.
Amphibian Man himself expresses elements of the Hero’s Journey, though he manifests at first as the archetype of the Victim,
kidnapped from his homeland, tortured, and helpless in chains. At
341
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
first, we might think he is the monster of this movie, mentioned
by Giles in the opening voiceover, but he starts to become more
human as he interacts with Elisa. Though fearsome in appearance,
he responds with grace to her gentle approaches. He rises to hero status and becomes active in the plot only after he is rescued and begins
to explore the strange new world of the apartment building. He has
a minor Ordeal when he confronts and kills Giles’s snarling cat and
goes wandering into the cinema. Elisa rescues him but he undergoes
a more serious Ordeal when he almost dies from lack of saltwater.
Revived, he enjoys a Hero’s Reward of intimacy with Elisa. In a final
Resurrection showdown, he comes close to death again from Strickland’s bullet but is healed and reborn through his own divine powers.
Although the final scene may be the wishful thinking of Giles, it
appears that Amphibian Man confers the final Elixir of rebirth on
Elisa, healing her wounds and transforming her scars into a new way
to live and breathe.
WHO IS THE MENTOR?
Though The Shape of Water has no character who functions as an
obvious Mentor for Elisa, the idea of mentoring manifests in several
ways. Through his gifts of medicine and advice, Dr. Hoffstetler finally
reveals himself as a Mentor. Giles, in his halting, excitable way, speaks
a bit of Mentor advice addressed to his younger self, but heard by
Elisa: “If I could take this brain of mine — this heart — and put in
it — If I could go back in time, when I was eighteen — I didn’t know
anything about anything — I would give myself a bit of advice, I tell
you — I'd say: Take better care of your teeth and f**k. A lot more.”
Elisa mentors the fearful Giles by her example of courage and determination to follow her dream. The sinister possibilities of mentoring
are represented by Hoffstetler’s handler Mihalkov and Strickland’s
boss General Hoyt who encourage but also threaten dire punishment
if their mentees fail to deliver results.
342
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
SHADOW
Obviously, the Shadow archetype is personified by those forces threatening Elisa and Amphibian Man; Strickland, General Hoyt, and
Mihalkov, but there is a longer shadow over the whole design, the
repressive, male-dominated culture of the mid-century whose influence still lingers. The behavior of the villains can be read as a critique
of the way we fear nature and try to dominate and exploit it, weaponize it, or make money from it. If we can’t, we would rather destroy
it than learn to live with it.
In Giles’s opening voiceover, he warns of a “monster who tried to
destroy it all? a slight bit of misdirection. In a conventional monster
movie, the strange creature would be the monster to fear and dread,
but in Del Toro’s universe, the creature is found to be deeply human
and the real monsters are cruel humans who have no respect for the
wonder of the world.
Strickland’s character is layered with evils. He is a sadist who gets
pleasure from torturing Amphibian Man and making Elisa uncomfortable with his lewd fantasies, and he supports his world view with
twisted interpretations of Bible stories. He hates Amphibian Man for
personal reasons, having gone to great trouble to capture him and then
being bitten by him, but also objects to the creature's very existence
as an affront to his idea of God, who probably looks a lot like Strickland, stern and vindictive.
Del Toro explains the Strickland character as a victim of his own
unrealistic desires, saying, “Strickland represents three things I find
terrifying: order, certainty, and perfection. He wants those three,
which are impossible, and they represent the torture of a life, because
no human can have any of them.” (Variety interview, January 10, 2018)
CONCLUSION
The Shape of Water has a lot on its mind. In addition to fulfilling Del
Toro’s vision of a monster love story, it can claim to be a salute to the
343
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
magic of classic Hollywood movies, a critique of male domination, a
cry of compassion for nature, a warm embrace of society’s underdogs,
and a warning that the clock is ticking and we have only so much
time to change our ways and transform our lives. Somehow Del Toro
manages this ambitious design with admirable economy and storytelling velocity. He grounds his fantastical story with a mountain of
realistic period details. His re-creation of a 1962 Cadillac dealership
is a minor masterpiece of set design. One tiny but telling detail rang
a bell of authenticity from my childhood. In the scene where Strickland drives home with his new car, we see his son and daughter playing
on the living room floor. The son is playing with plastic cowboy and
Indian figures and a lithographed tin cowboy cabin, exactly like ones
I had in 1962.
As a fan of the “Creature from the Black Lagoon” movies, I
would have been disappointed if Del Toro had completely neglected
these important mythic sources. Luckily for me, he honored them
with a couple of scenes which resonated with the Universal movies without actually copying them. When Amphibian Man begins
to explore the apartments of Giles and Elisa, and then the street and
theatre below, I couldn’t help thinking of The Creature Walks Among
Us in which the monster penetrates our ordinary world and wreaks
havoc and terror. True to Del Toro’s vision of telling the story through
the “monster’s” eyes, in The Shape of Water it’s the creature we fear for,
not the bystanders. And the moment near the end when Amphibian
Man dives into the canal with Elisa in his arms brought to mind the
iconic shot that appears in all three of the Universal films, always a terrifying moment as Gill-Man snatches a beautiful, screaming woman
and leaps into the water with her, taking her to an unknown fate in
his underwater lair. In The Shape of Water, Amphibian Man’s intent
is soon clear; he heals and transforms her into a being who can live
and love with him in his watery element. Who knows, perhaps that
was Gill-Man’s intention too, and if he hadn’t been harassed by pesky
344
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
scientists and macho adventurers back in the 1950s, he would have
performed the same miracle.
The Shape of Water was a crowd-pleasing entertainment, receiving almost universal applause from audiences and critics, though a few
pointed out minor flaws. Although Elisa is a compelling and memorable character as played by Sally Hawkins, she doesn’t quite fulfill the
potential of a Hero. She shows no hesitation or doubt about answering her Call to Adventure, so there is not much suspense about what
she might do. She doesn’t have any apparent flaws to overcome. However, for most people the charm of the feisty, spirited character made
up for any shortcomings.
The Shape of Water stretches logical limits at times, for instance
when security for the “most important Asset this lab has ever handled” is so lax that the two cleaning ladies are allowed to gawk as the
creature's metallic and glass container is wheeled in. Amphibian Man
is inexplicably left unguarded while Elisa is allowed plenty of romantic Approach time alone with him, and she is somehow unseen by the
surveillance cameras that are actively monitored in all other sections
of the lab. However, we should recall that The Shape of Water is not a
strict exercise in logic but Giles’s playful, poetic reverie in which such
departures from dull reality are unimportant.
Despite being set in the distant era of the 1960s, the movie struck
a timely chord for modern audiences who responded to its theme of
tolerance for “the Other.” Del Toro tells his story through the eyes of
several different Others who are marginalized — Elisa by her muteness, Olivia by inequality, Giles by his sexual identity and shyness, and
Amphibian Man by his strange and special nature that frightens the
“normal” people. All of them are looked down upon and threatened
by society’s idea of what is normal, but the love the characters have
for each other transcends all that. Speaking of the ultimate Others,
the horror movie monsters who merged with Catholic religious ideas
in his childhood, Del Toro has said, “When I was a young kid, I truly
345
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
was redeemed by these figures. Where other people saw horror, I saw
beauty. And where people saw normalcy, I saw horror. I realized that
the true monsters are in the human heart.” (Collider.com interview
by Christina Radish, Feb. 12, 2018)
Del Toro has said his ambition with The Shape of Water was to
“make a movie that people can hum on the way out of the theatre. Not
the music, but the movie. That you can hum about sex, about love,
about life, about empathy.” (Indiewire’s Awards Spotlight Series, January 23, 2018) When he talks about humming, I think he’s referring to
what I call changing the vibrational rate of the audience, stimulating
the organs of their bodies with images, sound, compelling characters
in challenging situations, and poetic associations of ideas. In The Shape
of Water he creates a dreamy, seductive mood that alters the subtle
vibrations of the audience like a well-crafted piece of music. Thanks to
his vision, heart, attention to detail, and passion for the movies, audiences could “hum” to this unconventional reimagining of the age-old
Hero’s Journey motifs.
STAR WARS
Before closing the book on the permutations of the Hero’s Journey in
popular films, I have to acknowledge the lasting impact of the Star Wars
series. The first Star Wars film, now retitled Star Wars Episode IV:.A New
Hope, was released in 1977 as I was just beginning to digest the ideas of
Joseph Campbell, and was a stunning confirmation of the power of the
mythic patterns I had found there. Here was a fully developed expression of his concept of the Hero’s Journey, exactly as Campbell described.
It helped me work out the theory and test my own ideas, and it quickly
became one of those quantum movie events, breaking records and setting a higher standard for what a movie could be.
As I began to teach “mythic structure,” the film provided a convenient, widely seen example to demonstrate the movements and
principles of the Hero's Journey, in which the function of the parts
346
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
were simple, clear, and vivid. It entered the language of pop culture,
providing useful metaphors, symbols, and phrases that expressed how
we all felt about good and evil, technology and faith. It spawned a
billion-dollar industry of sequels, prequels, ancillaries, franchises,
and a whole universe of toys, games, and collectibles. Entire generations have grown up under its influence, and it has inspired countless
artists to think big and pursue their dreams of creativity. It filled the
same function for millions that the old myths did, giving standards
for comparison, providing metaphors and meaning, inspiring people
to stretch beyond their earthly bounds.
If the Star Wars movie of 1977 had been a one-shot cinema event,
its cultural impact would still have been considerable, but its influence was tripled by the continuation of the series with Episode V: The
Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983).
Series creator George Lucas had always planned a vast canvas on the
scale of Wagner’s Ring cycle, an epic tale that might take a dozen
movies to tell in full. For the following sixteen years fans wondered if
Lucas would ever fulfill the promise of more films, extending the saga
into the past and possibly into the future. In what is known as “the
Expanded Universe,’ various side-plots and back-stories were developed in comic books, novels, cartoon series, and TV specials, but it
was only in 1999 that Lucas returned to the film series, eventually
producing three “prequel” films that told the story of the generation
before Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, and revealed the events and
character flaws that led to the development of Darth Vader, the series’
supreme embodiment of evil.
The master plan for organizing this huge canvas of six feature
films seems to reflect a polarized view of the universe and of the hero
myth itself, allowing full exploration of the dark and light possibilities
of the heroic model. The films released in the 1970s and ’80s represent the positively charged, optimistic view of heroism, in which the
young hero Luke Skywalker is severely tempted by power and rage
347
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
but ends up triumphant and morally balanced, an example of what
Campbell calls “the Master of Two Worlds.” The dramatic intention is
quite different in the three prequel films (The Phantom Menace/1999,
Attack of the Clones/2002, Revenge of the Sith/2005). Though sprinkled with moments of lightness and humor, the overall tone is dark
and tragic, showing the destruction of a human spirit by fatal flaws of
anger, pride, and ambition.
A mythic theme that seems to run through all the films is a fascination with the emotional territory between fathers and sons. The
impact of positive male role models, surrogate fathers and mentors
like Obi Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Qui-Gon Jinn, Luke’s Uncle Owen, and
Mace Windu is emphasized, but the series is as much interested in the
effect of absent or distant fathers and negative role models on a young
man’s developing personality.
The first three films released portray Luke Skywalker’s quest to
discover the identity of his father and his struggle with the dark tendencies in his own nature. Episode IV, the film released in 1977, more
or less follows an Arthurian model, with the young nobleman raised
in humble surroundings, unaware of his true nature, and watched
over by a Merlin-like figure (Obi-Wan) who gives him a powerful
weapon that belonged to his father, a lightsaber similar to Arthur’s
sword Excalibur.
In the next two films, Luke will discover more of his parentage
and learn that Princess Leia is his twin sister. His relationships with
surrogate fathers will continue to develop, losing Obi-Wan as a living
influence (though his ghostly presence continues to guide Luke) and
gaining a new father figure in Yoda. As he learns to master the Force
he is tempted by the dark side, represented by the villainous Darth
Vader, who eventually reveals himself as Luke’s true father. Like many
a hero before him, Luke must confront the fact that his father was
not perfect, and that he has some of the same dangerous tendencies
that made his father a tyrant and a monster. In this section the plot
348
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
somewhat resembles the Wagnerian scenario of Siegfried, the young
hero who must re-forge a broken sword that represents the failure of
the previous generation.
Luke passes a major Resurrection test in Episode VI: Return of
the Jedi, when he has the opportunity and the motivation to kill his
father, for Lord Vader is threatening to turn Luke’s sister Princess Leia
to the dark side of the Force. Luke spares his father’s life, signifying his
choice to uphold the positive side of the Force. The evil Emperor who
has manipulated Darth Vader and is a kind of evil father figure for him
now begins to destroy Luke with powerful lightning bolts. Moved by
the sight of his son’s impending death, Vader reverses polarity and
goes over to the light side of the Force, throwing the Emperor to his
death. Vader, dying himself from the struggle with the Emperor, asks
Luke to remove his helmet, revealing the fragile human beneath the
mask of technology. He seeks forgiveness and his son grants it. Luke,
though wounded, dismembered, and sorely tempted by his own dark
potential, ends up as a positively charged hero, able to use his powers
responsibly for the good of all. He is even able to forgive the fact that
his own father chopped off his arm and tried to kill him. One of the
final images of Episode VI, theoretically the absolute end of the series,
is that of the ghost of Darth Vader, redeemed and forgiven, standing
benevolent watch over his son alongside the ghosts of Obi-Wan and
Yoda, a trinity of father figures.
Sixteen years after the release of Episode VI, Lucas returned to
his unfinished canvas to fill in the first three episodes, detailing the
ascendancy of Luke’s father, the young Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker,
and his corruption into the totally evil Darth Vader. Continuing his
exploration of father-son or mentor-student relationships, in Episode
I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Lucas begins with a young Obi-Wan
training under his wise master, Qui-Gon Jinn. Qui-Gon and a galactic
princess, Padmé Amidala, find a brilliant, strong-willed nine-year-old
boy, Anakin Skywalker, who is a slave on the desert planet of Tatooine
349
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
where his son Luke Skywalker will later be raised. The boy, unnaturally skilled in mechanics and piloting, seems to be the fulfillment of
a Jedi prophecy that a “Chosen One’ will bring balance to the Force.
But already the seeds of evil are present in the child, who has a quick
temper and is difficult to control. Only Yoda seems to notice something is wrong with the boy, and warns that pride and anger may come
to dominate in him.
Interestingly in a story about fathers and sons, the boy Anakin
has no father in the conventional sense. Like many mythic heroes of
the past, his birth was almost miraculous, an “immaculate conception,” for his mother was impregnated not by a human father but by
mysterious microscopic lifeforms called “Midichlorians” that the Jedi
believe are channels for the Force. An important element in the moral
compass of the Star Wars series is how humans will make the transition from purely organic creatures into beings of the future enhanced
or modified by technology and machines. There are warnings implied
throughout the series that though the technological possibilities are
marvelous, we must be careful not to get out of balance, and yield
too much of our humanity to the chemical and mechanical possibilities that will come our way in the future. The fact that Anakin has no
natural father leads him to be alternately seeking and rebelling against
father figures, and helps explain how he is able to become the monstrous, more-than-half-machine that is Darth Vader.
The complex chronology of the films places the watcher of the
prequels in a curious position. On the one hand, young Anakin seems
to be doing the archetypal job of the hero, as the primary active character and someone whose fate we should care about. But it’s very
difficult to identify fully with a character who we know will turn out
to be a science fiction equivalent of Hitler or Genghis Khan, even if
we know he will be ultimately redeemed. Though the prequel films
performed extremely well at the box office, the dramatic experience
of watching them was necessarily muted by the knowledge that their
350
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
principal hero is fated to be a despicable villain. Many people watched
the prequel films with a certain detachment, unable to get behind the
hero's struggles as they had with Luke Skywalker’s in Episodes IV-VI.
Some of the audience’s need to identify with positively charged
characters was transferred from Anakin to other members of the
cast in the three prequel films, such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan,
Queen Padmé Amidala, and others. Nevertheless, a certain chilliness hangs over the prequel films, part of the artistic risk that Lucas
took in attempting such a large and complex composition. Anakin’s
story grows darker as the films progress. In Episode IT: Attack of the
Clones, his special status as a genius allows him to fall prey to pride
and arrogance. His mixed feelings about father figures lead him to
rebel against positive role models like Obi-Wan and Yoda and to seek
the twisted counsel of negative father possibilities like Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious.
That most human element, love, is awakened in the young Anakin
by his secret romance and marriage with Princess Amidala. However,
his capacity to love becomes distorted by the death of his mother at
the hand of Tusken raiders. In a sequence that recalls the Western
movie universe of John Ford’s The Searchers, Anakin finds his mother
horribly tortured by the savages and overreacts to her death, unleashing a tide of bloody revenge that makes him almost unredeemable in
an audience's eyes.
In Episode II: Revenge of the Sith, Anakin becomes obsessed
with the fear of losing that which he loves, Princess Amidala, and is
haunted by prophetic dreams of her dying in childbirth. He is thus
easy prey for the temptations of Senator Palpatine, who holds out
the promise of an elixir that can rescue loved ones from death. Anakin makes further bad choices, preventing positive Jedi mentor Mace
Windu from killing Palpatine and allowing Palpatine to kill Windu.
When Amidala pleads with him to leave public life, Anakin errs again,
351
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
choosing to remain at the center of things in the vain hope of overthrowing Palpatine someday.
Paradoxically, Anakin nearly causes that which he fears the most,
Amidala’s death, by almost strangling her when he suspects she has
betrayed him to Obi-Wan. She dies of a broken heart after giving
birth to the future Luke and Leia. Anakin’s descent into monsterhood is completed in a final duel with Obi-Wan, who cuts off both
his arms and one leg, leaving him to roll near the scorching lava of a
volcano. Palpatine, now revealed to be the evil schemer Darth Sidious,
rescues Anakin and uses machines to turn him into the less-thanhuman creature we know as Darth Vader. In this dark and tragic
climax, the only ray of hope is that the infants Luke and Leia are sent
to be raised by surrogate parents, Luke going to his aunt and uncle
on Tatooine and Leia being raised by a noble family, the Organas, on
the planet Alderaan.
Audiences and critics had mixed reactions to the three prequel
films, ranging from strong criticism of comic elements like the character of Jar Jar Binks to expressions of disappointment that Lucas
seemed to have lost some of the bright, cheerful spirit of episodes
IV-VI. One possible explanation for the markedly different tone of
the prequels is that Lucas was in a different stage of his life when he
returned to his youthful creation. In making the first three films in
the ’70s and ’80s, Lucas had only a short walk backwards to reach his
childhood, and was firmly in touch with the optimism and hopefulness of youth. The road back to innocence was a lot longer by 1999,
and his perspective was no longer that of a young rogue filmmaker, but
that of a responsible parent and head of a huge network of companies.
Although in Episode I Lucas was dealing with the early childhood of
his protagonist, Anakin Skywalker, the boy genius in the film sounds
more like a world-weary adult.
Though Lucas once said he had completed his original vision
with the first six feature films, the universe he founded continues
352
LOOKING BACK ON THE JOURNEY
to develop with a stream of movies, novels, comic books, animated
series, games, and toys, some supervised by Lucas, others now going
on independent of his personal control. The Star Wars universe has a
definite life of its own, quite apart from the intentions of its creator,
and has been embellished by countless original stories and artifacts
made by fans who feel they own it and want to live in it. For example, when the Disney+ series The Mandalorian was introduced, fans
embraced a minor character, named him Baby Yoda, and generated
a huge demand for toy versions of the little creature even before Disney had time to prepare products or a marketing campaign for its
latest star.
In 2001 I participated in the making of a documentary film, 4
Galaxy Far, Far Away, looking into the “Star Wars phenomenon” that
was cresting in the public imagination because of the revival of the
series. The film took a light-hearted view of the curious obsessions of
Star Wars fans and the importance of the movies in their lives. Given
that fathers and sons are so significant in the films, it’s not surprising that a major conclusion of the filmmakers was that the Star Wars
saga is one of the few cultural events that unites generations, making
strong bonds between fathers and sons. Many young men interviewed
for the documentary reported that the Star Wars films were among
the few movies that fathers and sons could watch together, and that
they had become an important part of family memories. Despite their
occasional flaws and missteps, the films collectively are an impressive
achievement of the mythic imagination, continuing the epic tradition and proving that abundant energy still surges in the motifs of
the Hero’s Journey.

he beauty of the Hero’s Journey model is that it
not only describes a pattern in myths and fairy
tales, but it’s also an accurate map of the territory one must travel to become a writer or, for
that matter, a human being.
The Hero’s Journey and the Writer’s Journey are one and the
same. Anyone setting out to write a story soon encounters all the
tests, trials, ordeals, joys, and rewards of the Hero’s Journey. We meet
all of its Shadows, Shapeshifters, Mentors, Tricksters, and Threshold
Guardians in the interior landscape. Writing is an often perilous journey inward to probe the depths of one’s soul and bring back the Elixir
of experience — a good story. Low self-esteem or confusion about
goals may be the Shadows that chill our work, an editor or one’s own
judgmental side may be the Threshold Guardians that seem to block
our way. Accidents, computer problems, and difficulties with time
and discipline may torment and taunt us like Tricksters. Unrealistic
dreams of success or distractions may be the Shapeshifters who tempt,
confuse, and dazzle us. Deadlines, editorial decisions, or the struggle
to sell our work may be the Tests and Ordeals from which we seem to
die but are Resurrected to write again.

THE WRITER’S JOURNEY

But take hope, for writing is magic. Even the simplest act of
writing is almost supernatural, on the borderline with telepathy. Just
think: We can make a few abstract marks on a piece of paper in a certain order and someone a world away and a thousand years from now
can know our deepest thoughts. The boundaries of space and time and
even the limitations of death can be transcended.
Many cultures believed the letters of their alphabets were far
more than just symbols for communication, recording transactions,
or recalling history. They believed letters were powerful magical symbols that could be used to cast spells and predict the future. The Norse
runes and the Hebrew alphabet are simple letters for spelling words,
but also deep symbols of cosmic significance.
This magical sense is preserved in our word for teaching children how to manipulate letters to make words: spelling. When you
“spell” a word correctly, you are in effect casting a spell, charging
these abstract, arbitrary symbols with meaning and power. We say,
“Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt
me,’ but this is manifestly untrue. We know that words have power
to hurt or heal. The simple words of a letter, telegram, or phone
call can strike you like a hammer blow. They’re just words — marks
on paper or vibrations of air — but mere words such as “Guilty,”
“Ready, aim, fire!” “I do,” or “We'd like to buy your screenplay” can
bind us, condemn us, or bring us joy. They can hurt or heal us with
their magic power.
The healing power of words is their most magical aspect. Writers, like the shamans or medicine men and women of ancient cultures,
have the potential to be healers.
WRITERS AND SHAMANS
Shamans have been called “the wounded healers.” Like writers, they
are special people set apart from the rest by their dreams, visions,
or unique experiences. Shamans, like many writers, are prepared for
356
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
their work by enduring terrible ordeals. They may have a dangerous
illness or fall from a cliff and have nearly every bone broken. They
are chewed by a lion or mauled by a bear. They are taken apart and
put back together again in a new way. In a sense they have died and
been reborn, and this experience gives them special powers. Many
writers come to their craft only after they have been shattered by life
in some way.
Often those chosen to be shamans are identified by special
dreams or visions, in which the gods or spirits take them away to
other worlds where they undergo terrible ordeals. They are laid out
on a table to have all their bones removed and broken. Before their
eyes, their bones and organs are split, cooked, and reassembled in a
new order. They are tuned to a new frequency like radio receivers. As
shamans, they are now able to receive messages from other worlds.
They return to their tribes with new powers. They can travel to
other worlds and bring back stories, metaphors, or myths that guide,
heal, and give meaning to life. They listen to the confusing, mysterious dreams of their people and give them back in the form of stories
that provide guidelines for right living.
We writers share in the godlike power of the shamans. We not
only travel to other worlds but create them out of space and time.
When we write, we truly travel to these worlds of our imagination.
Anyone who has tried to write seriously knows this is why we need
solitude and concentration. We are actually traveling to another time
and place.
As writers we travel to other worlds not as mere daydreamers, but
as shamans with the magic power to bottle up those worlds and bring
them back in the form of stories for others to share. Our stories have
the power to heal, to make the world new again, to give people metaphors by which they can better understand their own lives.
When we writers apply the ancient tools of the archetypes and
the Hero’s Journey to modern stories, we stand on the shoulders of

the mythmakers and shamans of old. When we try to heal our people with the wisdom of myth, we are the modern shamans. We ask
the same ageless, childlike questions presented by the myths: Who
am I? Where did I come from? What happens when I die? What
does it mean? Where do I fit in? Where am I bound on my own
Hero's Journey?

THE REST OF THE STORY:
ADDITIONAL TOOLS FOR MASTERING
THE CRAFT
Storytelling is far more than plot and characters. To be an effective storyteller, you will need many kinds of tools to express your ideas and reflect
your vision of reality. In this section we have gathered some of the mental
and emotional tools that have proven useful to past masters of the craft.
These chapters describe essential techniques, principles, and psychological realities that can give more depth and dimension to your writing.

Hollywood is a sink-or-swim industry where they rarely take time to
teach you anything, but I once got a useful lesson early in my career
when I was a reader for Orion Pictures. Our story editor, a seasoned
professional named Migs Levy, called a meeting of the readers to tell
us none of us had any idea what a scene was. I was surprised; I thought
I knew. In film school, I had picked up the idea that a scene is a short
piece of a movie, taking place in one location and one span of time, in
which some action takes place or some information is given.
“Wrong,” she said, and proceeded to explain that a scene is a business deal. \t may not involve money but it will always involve some
change in the contract between characters or in the balance of power.
It’s a transaction, in which two or more people enter with one kind of
deal between them, and negotiate or battle until a new deal has been
cut, at which point the scene should end.
It could be the overturning of a long-established power structure. The underdog seizes power by blackmail. The people rise up
against a dictator. Someone tries to leave a relationship or overcome
an addiction.
Or it could be the forging of a new alliance or enmity. Two people who hated each other make a new deal to work together in a
threatening situation. A boy asks a girl out and she accepts or rejects
360
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?
his offer. Two gangsters make an alliance to rub out a rival. A mob
forces a sheriff to turn a man over for lynching.
The meat of the scene is the negotiation to arrive at the new
deal, and when the deal is cut, the scene is over, period. If there’s no
new deal, it’s not a scene, or at least it’s not a scene that’s pulling its
weight in the script. It’s a candidate either for cutting or for rewriting
to include some significant exchange of power.
The story editor pointed out that many writers don’t know what
a scene is, either, and put in non-scenes that are just there “to build
character” or to get across exposition. They don’t know when to begin
and end a scene, wasting time with introductions and chitchat, and
dragging the scene out long after the transaction has been concluded.
The scene is the deal. When the deal is done, get off the stage.
I found this principle very useful in pinning down the essence of
a scene, and I found it also works at a macro level for identifying the
bigger issues in a script, for every story is the renegotiation of a major
deal, a contract between opposing forces in society. Romantic comedies are a renegotiation of the contract between men and women.
Myths, religious stories, and fantasies rework the compact between
humans and the greater forces at play in the universe. The terms of
the uneasy balance between good and evil are re-evaluated in every
superhero adventure and story of moral dilemma. The climax of many
movies is a courtroom judgment that lays out a new agreement, passing sentence on a wrongdoer, proclaiming someone's innocence, or
dictating terms of a disputed transaction. In all situations, we go in
with one deal and we come out with a new deal having been cut.
Knowing when the big deal of the movie has been cut tells you
when the movie should be over. Many movies today go on long after
they have truly ended, as far as the audience is concerned. They know
it’s over when the last term of the deal has been decided, and they get
restless if the filmmaker goes on with extra flourishes and codas and
flash-forwards to ten years later, et cetera. When I was a kid going to
361
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
drive-in movie theatres I noticed many people starting their engines
and driving away before the last movie of a double bill was quite over.
For them the deal of the whole movie was complete when the monster
was killed or the murderer was caught, and they didn’t need to stick
around to see the hero kiss the girl and ride off into the sunset. “When
the deal is done, get off the stage” is a good rule for both scenes and
the overall structure of stories.
ANOTHER DEAL: THE CONTRACT WITH THE
AUDIENCE
If a scene is a deal, then what is a story? One answer is that a
story, too, is a deal, but the contract in this case is not between characters in a scene but between you and your audience. The terms are
these: They agree to give you something of value, their money, but
also a much more valuable consideration, their time. As a screenwriter
you are asking them to pay attention to you and you only for ninety
minutes, and as a novelist for much longer. Think about that! Focused
attention has always been one of the rarest and most valuable commodities in the universe, and it’s even truer today, when people have
so many things fighting for their attention. So, for them to give you
even a few minutes of their focus is huge stakes to put on the table,
worth much more than the ten bucks or so they shell out for a book
or a movie ticket. Therefore, you'd better come up with something
really good to fulfill your part of the bargain.
There are many ways to fulfill that contract with the audience.
I used to think the “Hero’s Journey” model was the whole contract,
and an absolute necessity. I still think it is the most reliable way to
honor the terms of the deal with the audience, providing them with
a cathartic metaphor for their lives that includes a taste of death
and transformation. They tend to read it into any story anyhow,
and it’s actually hard to find a story that doesn’t display some of its
362
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?
elements. But I’ve come to see it’s not the only way to hold up your
end of the deal.
At a minimum you must be entertaining, that is, able to hold
their attention with something a little novel, shocking, surprising,
or suspenseful. Be sensational; that is, appeal to their sensations, give
them something sensual or visceral, some experience that they can feel
in the organs of their bodies, like speed, movement, terror, sexiness.
Laughter is another way to fulfill the contract with the audience.
People are so starved for laughter that a movie that makes you laugh
out loud a few times is probably going to be a hit. They'll overlook a
stupid or pointless story if the movie delivers on the laugh clause in
the contract. They didn’t go to see movies about Francis the Talking
Mule in the 1950s for the heartwarming, thought-provoking Hero's
Journey stories, and they don’t expect Alvin and the Chipmunks to
change their lives.
A good ride to another place and time can fulfill the contract. I
don’t remember much of the story of The Abyss but I felt well repaid
by being taken to a cool dark place under the sea for two hours on
a hot summer afternoon. James Cameron is great at creating entire
worlds, the elegant enclosed universe of Titanic, the ravishing cosmos
of Avatar, and his movies are rewarded with success because they satisfy the “take me to another place” part of the contract so well.
Giving the audience stars they like in appealing combinations
is a way the studios have always used to fulfill the contract with the
public. Breathless movie trailers used to proclaim: “You loved Tracy
and Hepburn in Adam’s Rib; here they are together again in Pat and
Mike!” Putting beloved stars into different costumes is another way
to satisfy the entertainment contract. “If you thought Russell Crowe
looked good in the gladiator outfit, you'll love him in the Robin
Hood suit!”
Sheer novelty weighs heavily with audiences, justifying the investment of their time and attention. It’s worth a lot to people to be able
363
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
UP IN THE AIR fulfilled the contract by expressing something in the zeitgeist.
to talk about the movie everyone’s buzzing about, be it Psycho, The
Crying Game, Pulp Fiction, The Blair Witch Project, The Passion of
the Christ, or 300. To fulfill that clause of the contract, there'd better
be something really strange, scary, shocking, thrilling, or surprising
inside that movie so that people can talk about it knowingly after
they've seen it.
One of the most powerful ways to honor the terms of the entertainment contract is to fulfill a deep wish held by many members of
the audience — to see the dinosaurs walk again in Jurassic Park, to fly
and wield superpowers in Superman, to be seduced by sexy teen vampires in the Twilight series. Walt Disney realized that fairytales were
driven by wishes and built his brand identity around giving people the
wholesome fantasy experiences they wanted, filled with wish-granting
fairy godmothers, wizards, and genies.
Sometimes a movie fulfills the contract by simply capturing
something in the zeitgeist, the prevailing mood of the moment. Moyies will sometimes accidentally line up with a current issue. Famously
The China Syndrome, dealing with a fictional nuclear plant meltdown,
364
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?
was released within days of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident
and became the movie everyone wanted to see. Up in the Air had
good performances and story but it also happened to be released, after
many years in preparation, just as many Americans found themselves
thrown out of work; its story of corporate gunslingers flying around
to fire people struck a chord. Of course a movie can also be killed by
current events. After the 9/11 attacks on the US., a number of movies
were shelved because they featured tall buildings being attacked and
destroyed. That was not the way people wanted to have their contract
fulfilled at that moment.
At first, I resisted the idea that it’s all wheeling and dealing — it
can’t just be about business, can it? But I came to see it is, in a way.
From the Bible on down we have lived by our contracts, for the Bible
is an account of the covenants or deals made between God and his
creation. We all have an unwritten deal with the rest of society, called
the social contract, to behave ourselves in return for our freedom and
relative safety. The essential documents of our civilization are contracts, agreements, or statements declaring the terms of a new deal,
from Hammurabi’s Code and the marriage contract to the Bill of
Rights. Just be sure when you tell your story that you've thought about
“W/hat’s the deal going down here?” in every scene and “What's the
big deal?” of the whole story. Think of the attention and time your clients, your audience, have put on the table, and try to fulfill your part
of the bargain with something that at least entertains them, grants
their wishes, perhaps stimulates and amuses them, and maybe even
transforms them a little bit.

PROPOSITION: STORIES ARE ALIVE AND CONSCIOUS AND RESPOND
TO HUMAN EMOTIONS.
t one point when the Disney company was
remaking itself in the 1980s, I was called upon
to review the major fairy tales of world cultures,
looking for potential animation subjects on the
order of Walt Disney’s colorful interpretations
of European folk stories, like “Snow White”
and “Cinderella” from the Brothers Grimm
and “The Sleeping Beauty” from Perrault’s collection of French fairy
tales. It was a chance to reopen the mental laboratory to study old
friends from my childhood that Walt Disney had not gotten around
to tackling, like Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin. It was also a great
367
THE WRITER'S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
opportunity for me to sample many kinds of stories from different
cultures, identifying similarities and differences and extracting storytelling principles from this broad sample.
In the course of my adult wanderings through what is normally
considered children’s literature, I came to a few firm conclusions
about stories, these powerful and mysterious creations of the human
mind. For instance, I came to believe that stories have healing power,
that they can help us deal with difficult emotional situations by giving us examples of human behavior, perhaps similar in some way to
the struggles we are going through at some stage of life, and which
might inspire us to try a different strategy for living. I believe stories have survival value for the human species and that they were
a big step in human evolution, allowing us to think metaphorically and to pass down the accumulated wisdom of the race in story
form. I believe stories are metaphors by which people measure and
adjust their own lives by comparing them to those of the characters.
I believe the basic metaphor of most stories is that of the journey,
and that good stories show at least two journeys, outer and inner: an
outer journey in which the hero tries to do something difficult or
get something, and an inner journey in which the hero faces some
crisis of the spirit or test of character that leads to transformation.
I believe stories are orientation devices, functioning like compasses
and maps to allow us to feel oriented, centered, connected, more
conscious, more aware of our identities and responsibilities and our
relationship to the rest of the world.
But of all my beliefs about stories, one that has been particularly
useful in the business of developing commercial stories for the moyies is the idea that stories are somehow alive, conscious, and responsive
to human emotions and wishes.
I have always suspected that stories are alive. They seem to be
conscious and purposeful. Like living beings, stories have an agenda,
something on their minds. They want something from you. They want
368
STORIES ARE ALIVE
to wake you up, to make you more conscious and more alive. They
want to teach you a lesson disguised as entertainment. Under the
guise of amusement, stories want to edify you, build up your character
just a little by showing a moral situation, a struggle, and an outcome.
They seek to change you in some small way, to make you just a bit
more human by comparing your behavior to that of the characters.
The living, conscious, intentional quality of stories is here and
there revealed in familiar fairy tales, like the one the Brothers Grimm
collected called “Rumpelstiltskin,” the tale of the little man with his
power to spin straw into gold and a mysterious desire to own a human
child. The story is found in many cultures where the little man is
known by strange and funny names like Bulleribasius (Sweden), Tittelintuure (Finland), Praseodimio (Italy), Repelsteelije (Holland), and
Grigrigredinmenufretin (France).
This was one of the stories that posed challenging questions in
the mental laboratory of my earliest childhood. Who was this little
man, where did he get his powers, and why did he want that human
child? What was the lesson the girl in the story was supposed to learn?
Later in life, as I returned to contemplate that story as part of my
work for Walt Disney animation, many of those mysteries remained,
but the deep wisdom of the folktale helped me understand that stories are alive, that they actively respond to wishes, desires, and strong
emotions in the characters, and that they are compelled to provide
experiences that teach us some lesson in life.
THE STORY OF RUMPELSTILTSKIN
The well-known tale begins with a lovely young girl in a dangerous situation, an archetypal damsel in distress. She is the daughter of a miller
who brags to the king that his daughter is so talented, she can even
spin straw into gold. The king, a literal-minded fellow, says, “That’s the
kind of talent I like!” and locks her in a room in his castle containing
only a spinning wheel and piles of straw, warning that he’s going to
369
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
have her killed in the morning if she doesn’t spin the straw into gold
as her daddy promised.
The girl doesn’t know what to do and begins to weep. At once the
door opens and a little man, or “manikin” as the tale says, comes in,
asking her why she is crying so. Apparently he has been attracted by
her strong emotions, as faerie folk are said to be. When she explains
her predicament he says he can spin straw into gold, no problem, and
asks what she can give him if he does the job for her. She hands over
her necklace and he at once sits down and spins the straw, whir, whiz,
whir, into shining gold wire on a spool.
In the morning, the little man has vanished. The king is very
pleased with the gold, but being greedy, locks the girl into a bigger
room with more straw, and again demands that she spin it all into
gold by dawn. If not, she will die. All alone in the room that night,
the girl feels hopeless and weeps once more. As if summoned again
by her emotions, the little man appears a second time. This time she
offers him a ring from her finger to get out of her predicament. Whir,
whir, whiz, straw is spun into gold.
The king finds bigger spools of gold wire in place of straw the
next morning and is delighted, but again is greedy and locks the girl
in the biggest room in the palace, stuffed to the ceiling with straw.
If she can turn it all into gold by dawn he will marry her, but if not,
she will die.
The girl’s weeping in the locked room attracts the little man for
a third time, but now she has nothing left to give him. So he asks her,
“If you become queen, will you give me your firstborn child?”
Thinking nothing of the future, the girl agrees. Whir, whir, whir,
the mountain of straw is spun into gold. The king collects his gold and
marries the girl as promised. A year goes by and the girl, now a queen,
has a beautiful child.
One day the little man comes and claims the child as his reward
for saving her life. Horrified, the young queen offers him all the riches
370
STORIES ARE ALIVE
of the realm, but the little man refuses, saying, “Something alive is
dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.” The girl laments and
cries so much that the manikin relents a little for, as we have seen, he
is very sensitive to human emotions. He strikes a new bargain with
her. If she can guess his name within three days, she will get to keep
the child. But she will never guess it, he says confidently, for he has a
very unusual name.
The queen stays up all night thinking of every name she’s ever
heard and sends out messengers far and wide to assemble lists of
unusual names. When the manikin comes to see her the first day,
she tries out all these names but none is right. On the second day she
sends out more messengers to the distant corners of the kingdom to
collect weird names, but again the little man’s name is not among
them and he goes away laughing, sure he will get to keep the child.
On the third day the queen’s most faithful, far-traveling messenger reports that he’s struck pay dirt. In his wanderings he didn’t
uncover any new names, but far away, atop a mountain, he did come
across a little house, in front of which a fire was blazing, and around
it was dancing a ridiculous little man. The messenger heard him shout
a rhyme that revealed his name was Rumpelstiltskin.
The little man appears once more in the queen’s room, sure she
will be unable to guess his absurd name. But after two bad guesses
(“Conrad?” “Harry?”), she gets it right — Rumpelstiltskin! The
tale ends abruptly as the little man, crying out that the devil must
have told her his name, stamps his right foot so furiously that it goes
through the floor and sticks deep in the earth. With his two hands he
seizes the other foot and literally tears himself in two!
A fitting end for one who has connived to take a human child
from its mother. Or is it?
Who is this strange little man with his supernatural powers to
enter locked rooms and spin straw into gold? Although the tale only
calls him a “little man” or “manikin,” he is clearly one of the faerie
371
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
people of worldwide folklore, perhaps an elf or a gnome. The oral storytellers may have avoided calling him what he is because the faerie
folk are notoriously touchy about their names and identities. But it
is likely that any hearer of this tale in medieval times would instantly
recognize the little man as a supernatural creature from the faerie
world. Like other denizens of that world he appears when he wants
to and only to certain people. Like them, he is interested in human
children and attracted by strong human emotions.
From early times people have associated the faerie folk with a
certain sadness, perhaps because they lack some things that human
beings take for granted. According to one theory, they are unable to
conceive their own young and are therefore fascinated by human children, sometimes kidnapping them in the night, as Shakespeare’s faerie
queen Titania snatched an Indian princeling as her darling toy in 4
Midsummer Night's Dream. Sometimes the faeries steal children from
their cradles and replace them with blocks of wood or soulless replica
children called changelings.
The faeries’ ability to feel emotions may be different from ours,
for they seem to be curious about our emotional outbursts, and are in
fact attracted to them. It’s as if they exist in a parallel dimension but
are summoned into our world by strong human emotions, as demons
and angels supposedly can be summoned by ritual ceremonies and
prayers intended to focus emotional energy. Some authorities hold
that faeries do not know simple human emotions like love or grief but
are intensely curious to know what they are missing.
Re-experiencing the story of “Rumpelstiltskin” as an adult, I was
struck by how instantaneously the girl’s tears of despair summoned
the little man. Implied in the girl’s weeping is a cry for help, a wish.
If given words, it might be “Please, get me out of this!” It appears the
inhabitants of the faerie world are attracted to human emotions especially when they are focused into wishes. In this case, the wish is to get
out of a desperate, hopeless situation. In the fairy-tale logic of cause
372
STORIES ARE ALIVE
and effect, the girl’s shedding of tears is a positive action that generates a positive result. By crying, she acknowledges her powerlessness
and sends out a signal to the world of spirits that surrounds us. “Isn’t
there someone with the magical powers my father claimed for me,
who can get me out of this uncomfortable spot?” And the story hears,
and responds by sending a messenger, a supernatural creature who has
the power to grant her unspoken wish to escape.
However, as always, there’s a catch. The price for getting out of
her trouble is very high, escalating from material treasures, like a necklace or a ring, to life itself. But the girl isn’t thinking about that right
now. Having a child is a remote possibility. When she gets to that
point, maybe she can work something out or maybe the little man
will just go away. Whatever the risk, she'll agree to it to get out of that
room and out of danger from the king’s wrath. Her wish to escape,
expressed by a strong burst of emotion, has called the little man and
the adventure into being.
THE POWER OF WISHING
I began to realize that wishing may be an underlying principle of
storytelling. The hero is almost always discovered in a difficult or
uncomfortable situation, very often making a wish to escape or to
change the conditions. The wish is often verbalized and is clearly
stated in the first act of many movies. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy’s song “Somewhere over the Rainbow” is a wish to escape to a
land where troubles are far behind her. In Lost in Translation, Scarlett Johansson’s character expresses the theme of the movie in a line
in the first act where she says to Bill Murray’s character, meeting in a
Japanese hotel bar, “I wish I could sleep,’ symbolizing a wish for spiritual and emotional peace.
The expression of a wish, even a frivolous one, near the beginning
of a story has an important function of orientation for the audience.
It gives a story a strong throughline or what is called a “desire line,”
373
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
organizing the forces in and around the hero to achieve a clear goal,
even if that goal may later be reexamined and redefined. It automatically generates a strong polarization of the story, generating a conflict
between those forces helping the hero achieve her goal, and those trying to prevent it.
If the wish is not expressed by one of the characters, it may be
implied by the character’s dire situation. Audience members making
strong identification with a character in trouble will make the wish
themselves, desiring the hero to be happy, triumphant, or free, and
getting themselves in alignment with the forces polarizing the story.
Spoken or not, the story hears the wish, seemingly attracted by
the intense emotion contained in it. Carl Jung had a motto carved
above his door, “Vocatus atque non vocatus, Deus aderit,” which
loosely translated means “Summoned or not, the god will come.” In
other words, when the emotional conditions are right, when the need
is great, there is an inner cry for change, a spoken or unspoken wish
that calls the story and the adventure into being.
The story’s response to the human wish is often to send a messenger, sometimes a magical little man like Rumpelstiltskin, but always
some kind of agent who leads the hero into a special kind of experience we call an adventure — a sequence of challenges that teach the
hero, and the audience, a lesson. The story provides villains, rivals,
and allies to challenge or aid the hero and impart the lessons that are
on the story’s agenda. The story sets up moral dilemmas that test the
hero’s beliefs and character, and we are invited to measure our own
behavior against that of the players in the drama.
The adventure has a special quality of the unexpected. The story
is tricky. It acts in the roundabout, indirect, slightly mischievous way
of the faerie folk who are its frequent agents, providing the hero with
a series of unexpected obstacles that challenge the way the person has
been doing business. It usually grants the hero’s wish but in an unexpected way, a way that teaches the hero a lesson about life. Many of
374
STORIES ARE ALIVE
life’s teachings can be boiled down to “Be careful what you wish for,
which is a lesson taught by countless science-fiction and fantasy stories as well as love stories and stories of ambition.
WANTS VERSUS NEEDS
Through the triggering device of wishes, stories seem to like arranging
events so that the hero is forced to evolve to a higher level of awareness. Often the hero wishes for something that she or he desperately
wants at that moment, but the story teaches the hero to look beyond,
to what he or she really needs. A hero may think she wants to win a
competition or find a treasure, but in fact the story shows that she
needs to learn some moral or emotional lesson: how to be a team
player, how to be more flexible and forgiving, how to stand up for
herself. In the course of granting the initial wish, the story provides
hair-raising, life-threatening incidents that challenge the hero to correct some flaw in his or her character.
By imposing obstacles to the hero in achieving the goal, the story
may appear to be hostile to the hero's well-being. The intention of the
story may seem to be to take something away from the hero (like life
itself!), but in fact the real aim of the story is benevolent, to teach the
hero the needed moral lesson, to fill in a missing piece in the hero's
personality or understanding of the world.
The lesson is presented in a particular, ritualized way, reflecting
a more universal principle we might call “Not Only ... But Also”
(NOBA). NOBA isa rhetorical device, a way of presenting information that can be found in “fortunetelling” systems like the I Ching
and the Tarot. Not Only... But Also means: Here is a truth that you
know perfectly well, but there is another dimension to this truth of
which you may not be aware. A story might be telling you, through
the actions of a character, that not only are your habits holding you
back but also if you keep going in this direction your habits will
destroy you. Or it might be telling you that not only are you beset
o>
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
with difficulties, but also these very difficulties will be the means to
your ultimate victory.
In Lajos Egri’s famous example from “the Scottish play,’ the
premise is that Macbeth’s ruthless ambition inevitably leads to his
destruction. But Macbeth doesn’t see it that way, not at first. He
thinks only that ruthless ambition leads to power, to being king.
But the story, summoned into life in response to Macbeth’s thirst for
power, teaches him a lesson in NOBA form. Ambition leads not only
to being king, but also to Macbeth’s destruction.
The words “but” and “however,” as lawyers know, are very useful for setting terms and conditions, and can be powerful tools of
rhetoric and storytelling. A story is like a long sentence or a paragraph, with a subject, the hero; an object, the hero’s goal; and a verb,
the emotional state or physical action of the hero. “So and so wants
something and does something to get it.” The NOBA concept introduces the word “but” or “however” into that sentence. Now it’s “So
and so wants something and does something to get it, but there are
unexpected consequences, forcing so and so to adapt or change in
order to survive.”
The aim of good storytelling is to get the audience to make the
wish along with the hero. Stories do this through the process of “identification,” by making the hero sympathetic, the victim of a misfortune
or an understandable error of judgment. Good storytellers invite audiences to invest themselves in the fate of the characters by making
them likeable or giving them universal drives, desires, and human
weaknesses. Ideally, what happens to the hero is happening, on some
emotional level of connection, to the audience. The story and the hero
are not the only active agents in the drama. The members of the audience are also agents in the play, emotionally involved, actively wishing
for the hero to win, learn the lesson, survive, and thrive. They identify
with heroes in a threatened position where it appears their wishes may
not be granted and their real needs may not be met.
376
STORIES ARE ALIVE
The wishes of heroes are a strong point of identification for many
people, since we all have wishes and desires that we secretly cherish. In
fact, that’s one of the main reasons we go to movies and watch TV and
read novels — to have our wishes granted. Storytellers are, most of the
time, in the wish-granting business. The Disney empire built its entire
corporate identity around the belief in wishing, from its theme song
“When You Wish Upon a Star” to the wish-granting fairy godmothers of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, to the genie who grants three
wishes in Aladdin. Hollywood executives and bestselling novelists aim
to know the secret wishes of their audiences and fulfill them. Popular
stories of recent years have granted widely held wishes to walk with the
dinosaurs, trod the soil of alien planets, seek high adventure in mythic
realms or in times gone by, and outpace the boundaries of space, time,
and death itself. So-called “reality television” grants wishes on a nightly
basis, bestowing on ordinary people the thrill of being seen by millions
and having a shot at stardom, riches, or love. Politicians and advertisers
play on the wishes of the public, promising to grant security, peace of
mind, or comfort. A good technique of Hollywood pitching is to begin
by asking “Did you ever wish you could —” (fly, be invisible, go back in
time to fix your mistakes, etc.), connecting up the desires of the story's
hero with a strong wish that a lot of people might have.
THE WISHES OF THE AUDIENCE
It pays to think about what audience members wish for themselves
and the heroes in stories. As writers we play a tricky game with our
readers and viewers. We evoke a strong wish through our characters,
then spend most of the story frustrating the wish, making it seem
that the characters will never get what they want or need. Usually, in
the end, we grant those wishes, and show how they are achieved by
struggle, by overcoming obstacles, and by reconsidering them, with
the desire sometimes shifting from what the hero thinks she wants to
what she really needs.
377
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
We thwart the deep wishes of the audience at our peril. Movies
that deny the wishes of the audience to see the heroes ultimately happy
or fulfilled may not perform well at the box office. The audience will
inwardly cheer for poetic justice — the hero receiving rewards proportionate to his struggle, the villain receiving punishment equivalent to
the suffering he has inflicted on others. If that sense of poetic justice
is violated, if the rewards and punishments and lessons don’t match
up to our wishes for the characters, we sense something is wrong with
the story, and go away unsatisfied.
We have wishes for our villains as well as our heroes. I remember
my mother, an astute critic of popular movies and books, muttering
under her breath phrases like “I hope he dies a horrible death,” when
a villain had done something particularly heinous to one of her heroes
on the screen. If the movie didn’t deliver a poetically appropriate fate
for the villain, she was disappointed and that movie went down in her
books as a bad one.
Once in a while, the strategy of thwarting the audience’s desires is
effective, to challenge the assumptions of the watchers, to reflect a harsh
view of reality, or to depict a tragic, doomed situation as a kind of warning to the audience. For example, in the novel and movie Remains of the
Day, the butler to the family of a British lord spends his entire life failing to connect emotionally with other people. His wish, we might say,
is to have a sense of tight control over his personal life, one area where
he does not compromise. This masks a deeper desire, the need to make
an emotional and physical connection with another human being. The
audience forms a strong wish for him to be happy, to seize an opportunity for intimacy that comes his way late in life. But, true to his tragic
character, he doesn’t take the chance for change, and the movie ends
with the feeling that though he has gotten what he wants (privacy and
control), he will never get what he needs, or what we wish for him and
ourselves. It plays as a cautionary tale, a warning to us — if we don’t take
up the opportunities that life offers us, we could end up frustrated and
378
STORIES ARE ALIVE
alone. In this case, our wish to see the character happy is superseded by
our need to realize that we could end up in the same sad situation if we
don’t open up to opportunities to love.
The focus on wishing that gives life to many tales is but one of the
verbs that activate the emotional mechanisms of story. Wishes must be
translated into action, dreams must be made real, or else the story, and
perhaps a person’ life, will stagnate, stuck in an unrealistic, endless fantasy of daydreaming. Wishing is important, for it is the first step in a
pyramid of mental states, the yearning of a seed to grow into something
great. It forms the initial intention of a story, or the beginning of a new
phase of someone’s life. “Be careful what you wish for” applies in a multitude of cases, as stories show us over and over that a wish is a powerful
act of the imagination. The idea is constantly affirmed in stories that
human imagination is extremely powerful, especially when focused into
a wish, but that it is difficult to control. The wish and the imagination
work together to create a mental image of the desired thing, person, situation, or outcome, so vivid that it calls the adventure into being, and
launches the hero in the direction of seeing how the wish will actually
be fulfilled, usually in an unsuspected and challenging way. The image
may be faint and hazy in the beginning, or detailed but highly idealized
and unrealistic, a fantasy of the future uninformed by real experience.
But for a story or a person’s life to move along it is necessary to
pierce the bubble of fantasy, and to convert wishing into something
else — doing, the next step of the pyramid. The essence of movies is
the director’s command, “Action.” Do something, actors. The root of
the word “actor” is “do-er, someone who does something. Dreams
and wishes must be tested in the crucible of reality, in action, by doing.
PROGRESSING FROM WISHING TO WILLING
Encountering conflicts and obstacles can force characters to evolve to
a yet higher level on the pyramid of emotions, that of willing, which
is quite a different mental state than mere wishing. Martial arts and
379
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
classic philosophies teach people to develop a strong will, so that
wishes can be transformed into actions, so that even when distracted
or set back by obstacles, the developing personality can return quickly
to the center line of its intention. Will is a wish concentrated and
focused into a firm intention to achieve a goal step by step. Wishes
can evaporate at the first setback but the will endures.
Willing is a kind of filter, separating those who only wish from
those who actually take responsibility for improving themselves and
pay the price of real change. With a focused will, a character can take
the blows and setbacks that life hands out. Martial arts strengthen
the will, as stories do, by delivering a series of blows and falls that
toughen the student. Challenging and stressful situations are repeatedly introduced so that the developing person becomes mote resilient,
accustomed to conflict and opposition, and determined to overcome
any obstacle.
Like making a wish, making an act of the will calls forces into
motion. A strong act of will sends out signals to the world. Here is
someone who wants something and is willing to pay a high price to
get it. All sorts of allies and opponents will be summoned by such a
declaration, each with its lesson to teach.
Like wishing, the will must be managed. A will for power can
be dangerous, and an overly strong will can overpower and victimize
weaker ones. But the development of a strong will, outgrowing the
stage of simple wishing, is a necessary stage of human development.
There is a connection between needs and willing. Both evolve
from the idea of wishing or wanting. Once you progress beyond wishing to knowing what your needs truly are, you can focus your vague
wishes into much more concentrated acts of the will. All the levels
of your being can be aligned in the direction of achieving a clear and
realistic goal. The girl in “Rumpelstiltskin” starts as a Passive victim,
just crying her eyes out and sitting alone in a room wishing to be anywhere but there. When she is a little older and realizes she needs to
380
STORIES ARE ALIVE
protect the life of her child, she develops a will and applies it again
and again until she accomplishes her goal.
The language of movies and fantasy, particularly that of the Disney variety, tends to show us the magical power of wishing but often
stops short at that point, leaving the other steps of the pyramid unsaid
but implied. Often fantasies are dedicated solely to exploring the
mechanisms of wishing, developing the “Be careful what you wish for”
concept to show that wishes might have to be refined or re-stated to
adjust to reality, without necessarily evolving into the more powerful
and focused mental state of willing an outcome. Sometimes an entire
story remains in the wish mode by ending not with the development
of a strong will, but the forming of a new wish, simply transferring
unfocused desire from one object to the next.
Wishing and willing can be selfish mental states, and there are
undoubtedly other possible steps higher on the pyramid of human
emotional development, which might include learning to love, learning to have compassion for other beings, or in a few highly spiritual
stories, learning to transcend human desires entirely to merge with a
higher form of consciousness. But it’s clear that wishing and its more
evolved form, willing, are important tools for storytellers and necessary stages of everyone’s development. Wishing in particular seems to
invite a story to come to life and consciousness, launching an adventure that may teach us valuable lessons in survival.
And what about poor Rumpelstiltskin, tearing himself in two
because he can’t have the child he wants for unknown purposes? The
outcome of the story doesn’t seem fair. True, he has tried to kidnap a
child from its mother, but what if he has a right to the child? The Queen
has a bad record of motherhood, having bartered her child’s life for her
freedom, and the presumed father, the King, would make a menacing
role model for a child, having threatened to behead his future wife. For
all we know, the little man might have made a better parent to the child
than either of them. Rumpelstiltskin loses the child because the young

Queen is able to meet his seemingly impossible conditions, but what
if he has a right to custody of the child, and not because of the deal he
made with her that night? After all, what is there to do in an empty
room for three nights when all the straw has been spun into gold?
QUESTIONS
1. Have you noticed examples of characters making wishes early in
stories? Give an example and tell how the wish was granted (or
not) by the story.
2. What has been the role of wishing in your life? Have you learned
to be careful what you wish for? Is there a story in that experience?
3, What are your short-term and long-term wishes, and how can
you convert them into will and action? How would that work for
characters in your story?
4. Can you think of examples of a story providing an unexpected
answer to a character’s wish? Write a story around the idea of
someone wishing for something.
5. Are there wishes expressed or implied in other classic fairy tales
and myths? How are the wishes granted or denied? Write a modern version of a fairy tale or myth and use the concept of wishing.
6. Read a myth, view a movie, read a book and analyze what universal wishes the story satisfies. What human wishes are expressed
in your story?
7. Are there such things as fate or destiny? What do these terms
mean to you? Do they have a role any more in modern life?
8. Brainstorm around the concept of wishing. Write the word in the
center of a blank page and then around it write all the things you have
wished for or are now wishing for in the future. See if some patterns
emerge. Are your wishes realistic? What happens when your wishes
are granted? What is keeping you from granting your own wishes?
Apply the same exercise to a character. What is he or she wishing for?
How do they convert wishing into will to achieve their goals?

— Woody Allen
persistent feature of the Hero’s Journey is that
its stories tend to be polarized like two essential forces of nature, electricity and magnetism.
Like them, stories create energy or exert force
through polarities that organize the elements
present into opposing camps with contrasting properties and orientations. Polarity is an essential principle of scorytelling, governed by a
few simple rules but capable of generating infinite conflict, complexity, and audience involvement.
A story needs a sense of oneness — unity — to feel like a satisfying and complete expression. It needs a single theme — a spine
— something to unite it into a coherent work. But a story also needs
a level of two-ness, a dimension of duality, to create tension and the
possibility of movement. As soon as you choose a single thought or
character to unite your story, you have automatically generated its
polar opposite, a contrary concept or antagonistic character, and
therefore a duality or polarized system that conducts energy between
the two parties. Unity begets duality; the existence of one implies the
possibility of two.
385
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
As soon as you imagine two points in space, you have generated
a line of force between them and the potential for interaction, communication, deal-making, movement, emotion, and conflict.
If your story is about the single quality of trust, the possibility of
suspicion immediately arises. Suspicion is necessary to test and challenge the concept of trust. If your main character wants something,
there must be someone who doesn’t want her to get it, who brings out
hidden qualities in your hero by opposing her. If not, there’s no story.
We enjoy stories that are polarized by a struggle between two strong
characters, like The African Queen or Driving Miss Daisy, but we are
also entertained by stories polarized by great principles of living that
tug the characters in two directions at once, so they are torn between
duty and love, for example, or between revenge and forgiveness. Many
a show-business tale like The Buddy Holly Story is polarized by loyalty
and ambition; loyalty to the group that the hero grew up with versus
the demands of ambition that require ditching those people when the
hero moves to a new level of success.
a POLARIZED SYSTEM
“POSITIVE” POLE “NEGATIVE” POLE
Every aspect of the Hero's Journey is polarized along at least two
lines, the inner and outer dimensions and the positive and negative
possibilities for each element. These polarities create potential for
contrast, challenge, conflict, and learning. As the polarized nature of
magnetic fields can be used to generate electrical energy, polarity in a
story seems to be an engine that generates tension and movement in
the characters and a stirring of emotions in the audience.
386
POLARITY
We live in a polarized universe, both as a physical fact all around
us and as a deeply ingrained mental habit. On the physical level we
are ruled by the very real polarities of day and night, up and down,
earth and space, inside and outside. Our bodies are polarized, with
limbs and organs distributed to the left and right sides, and a brain
whose left and right sides have quite different responsibilities. Polarized categories like age and youth or life and death are realities that
no one can ignore.
The Universe itself seems to be polarized into systems like matter and energy, matter and antimatter, atoms that carry plus or minus
charges, positive or negative poles in magnetism and electricity. Our
entire galaxy is polarized, a spinning disk of stars, dust, and gases that
has definite north and south poles and its own polarized magnetic
field. And of course the whole world of modern computer technology
has been generated from a simple binary system, 0 and 1, a polarized
off-on switch which apparently can yield infinite computing power
from one little polarity.
Polarity is an equally pervasive force as a habit of thinking. We
often act as if all questions have a right or wrong answer, all statements are either true or false, people are either good or bad, normal
or abnormal. Either a thing is real or it isn’t. Either you are with me
or against me. Sometimes these categories are useful, but they can also
be limiting and may not adequately represent reality. Polarization is
a powerful force in politics and rhetoric, allowing leaders and propagandists to mobilize anger and passion by artificially dividing the
world into “us” and “them” categories, a simplification of the world
that makes it easier to deal with, but ignores many intermediate or
alternative points of view.
However, polarity is a real phenomenon in human relationships
and an important engine of conflict in storytelling. Characters in
relationships strongly tend to become polarized as part of their process of growing and learning through conflict. Polarity follows certain
387
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
rules, and good storytellers instinctively exploit them for their dramatic potential.
THE RULES OF POLARITY
1. OPPOSITES ATTRACT
The first rule of polarity is that opposites attract. A story is in some
ways like a magnet with its mysterious, invisible power of attraction. Two magnets, properly aligned, with the south pole of one
pointed at the north pole of the other, will strongly attract each
other, just as two contrasting characters can be drawn powerfully
to one another. The clash of their differences attracts and holds an
audience’s attention.
Two lovers, friends, or allies may be attracted to one another
because they complete one other, perhaps clashing at first because
they possess contrasting qualities, but discovering that each needs
something the other has. Unconsciously, people may seek out those
whose strengths and weaknesses balance weak and strong qualities in
themselves.
Hero and villain may be locked together in a struggle, drawn
together by circumstances but operating in strongly contrasting,
polarized ways that show the whole range of possible human responses
to a stressful situation. Nations may be drawn into polarized conflicts
because of radically opposed ways of perceiving reality.
2. POLARIZED CONFLICT ATTRACTS THE AUDIENCE
A polarized relationship naturally generates conflict as the characters at two contrasting extremes explore and challenge each other’s
boundaries, concepts of the world, and strategies for living. We find
this endlessly fascinating. Conflict, like magnetic energy, is attractive,
automatically drawing the attention of the spectator. As a magnet or
a magnetized object has the power to attract certain metals like iron
388
POLARITY
and nickel, so a polarized, conflict-filled human situation attracts and
focuses the attention of an audience or a reader.
3. POLARITY CREATES SUSPENSE
Polarity generates not only struggle but also suspense about the outcome. Which world-view will triumph in the end? Which character
will dominate? Who will survive? Who's right? Who will win, who
will lose? What are the consequences when a hero chooses one side
or the other of a polarity? A polarized system attracts our attention
initially because we all perceive that our lives are sawed back and forth
by similar contradictions and conflicts, tugging us in many directions
at once along multiple lines of polarity, such as man and wife, parent
and child, employee and boss, individual and society. We continue
to watch with interest to see how the polarized situations will turn
out, looking for clues about how to handle these challenges in our
own lives.
4. POLARITY CAN REVERSE ITSELF
When the conflict heats up after several rounds of conflict between
the two sides in a polarized drama, the forces that draw two people
together may reverse themselves, changing from a force of attraction
to a force of repulsion. Two magnets that have been stuck together
will fly apart if one of them is flipped so that its polarity is reversed.
A moment before, they had been so strongly attracted to each other
that it was difficult to pull them apart, and the next moment it’s
almost impossible to force them together, so strong is the force of
repulsion.
Among the curious properties of electrical and magnetic fields is
the fact that the polarity of these systems can abruptly reverse itself.
The direction the energy is flowing in alternating current electrical
systems flips back and forth from positive to negative fifty or sixty
times a second, while the magnetic fields of heavenly bodies reverse
389
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
polarity infrequently but on some mysterious timetable. For reasons
that are poorly understood, the giant magnetic field of the sun reverses
its polarity every eleven years or so, generating immense storms of
radiation that wash over the earth like invisible tsunamis and disrupt communications and electronics worldwide. Scientists believe
the magnetic field of the Earth has flipped poles many times over
thousands of years, presumably making magnets and compasses point
south for much of the lifetime of the planet. Reversals of polarity on
this giant scale seem to be part of the life cycle of stars and planets,
like a gigantic heartbeat.
Such reversals are also part of the life cycle of a story. They may
be temporary, quick reversals of attraction or power within a scene,
or they may be major hinges or turning points of a story. Within a
scene, a quick change of polarity might happen because one of the
lovers gets a new piece of information that reverses his or her attitude, say from trust to mistrust, or from physical attraction to disgust.
The piece of information might turn out to be false, only temporarily
challenging the attraction of opposites, but it creates tension along
the line of energy that connects the two characters, and that tension
makes good drama.
5. REVERSALS OF FORTUNE
Reversal of polarity in a story can be the abrupt overturning of a character’s fortune, a change of luck or circumstances that switches the
prevailing conditions from negative to positive or vice versa. Good
stories have at least three or four of these reversals for the main character, some have many, and some are even constructed so that they
produce reversals of fortune in every scene. In fact, that might be a
good minimum requirement for a scene — that it produce at least
one reversal of fortune for someone on some level of the story. A shift
in power, the underdog standing up to the bully, the fates dealing a
blow to the victorious athlete, a lucky break or a sudden setback, all
390
POLARITY
these are reversals of polarity that punctuate a story and give a sense
of dynamic movement. The moments of reversal can be thrilling and
memorable, like the scene of Norma Rae standing up in the factory
to organize the workers.
ARISTOTLE’S CONCEPT OF REVERSAL
Aristotle in his Poetics describes the essential dramatic device of the
reversal. He calls it peripeteia, which refers to the “Peripatos” or covered walkway of Aristotle’s Lyceum where he used to walk and talk
with his students, developing ideas as they strolled back and forth.
Perhaps he used the structure to demonstrate his logic, building up an
argument forcefully as they traversed the colonnade in one direction,
then demolishing it just as thoroughly on the reverse trip.
Aristotle says the sudden reversal of a situation for the protagonist can produce the desirable emotions of pity and terror in the
audience; pity for someone who suffers undeserved misfortune, and
terror when it happens to someone like us. A story captures our emotions by putting someone a little like us in a threatening situation
that repeatedly reverses the hero's fortunes. Think of the reversals of
fortune in movies like Papillon, Shakespeare in Love, or The Far Side
of the World, with the sympathetic characters alternating between
moments of freedom or triumph and periods of danger, disappointment, and defeat.
Reversals of fortune in the life of a hero are inevitable and they
make for good entertainment, holding our attention as we watch to
see what will happen next, and wonder if the positive or negative
energies will dominate at the end of the story. Even if we know the
outcome, as in the movie Titanic, we enjoy watching how the contest
plays out and how the characters react to the ups and downs dealt out
by fate or the playwright. In a well-constructed story these repeated
reversals accumulate power, adding up to the emotional impact that
Aristotle claimed was the point of it all: catharsis, an explosive and
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
physical release of emotion, be it tears of pity, shudders of terror, or
bursts of laughter. The reversals, like drumbeats, impact our emotions,
triggering reactions in the organs of our bodies. By Aristotle’s theory,
these drumbeats were supposed to accumulate tension in the bodies
of the audience members until the biggest beat of all, at the climax of
the play, released a pleasurable shudder of emotion that was believed
to cleanse the spirit of poisonous thoughts and feelings. Stories retain
their power to release cathartic emotions which is still a profound
human need.
CATASTROPHIC REVERSAL
Since the beginning of Greek drama in Aristotle’s day, the name for
the biggest reversal in a character’s fortunes has been “catastrophe.”
“Kata-” means “over” or “down” in Greek and “strophe” is “turn” or
“twist,” thus a catastrophe is an overturning or down-twisting. “Strophe” may also refer to a strap or a strip of leather or a length of plant
fiber that could be woven into a basket, and is the parent of our words
for strip, stripe, strap, and strop. It suggests that a play is a kind of
weaving in which the strands of the plot, the fortunes of the various
characters, interlock and crisscross, typically with the fortunes of the
antagonist going up when the luck of the hero is going down and
vice versa. A strophe in a classical Greek drama was a turning movement across the stage by part of the chorus, which recited a critical
line of text to accompany the move. This was balanced by an opposite
turn by another part of the chorus reciting an answering line of text,
called the anti-strophe. It made the drama into a kind of polarized
dance with the movements and phrases representing contradicting
threads of thought or emotion within the society. We speak of “turning points” in stories and these are usually examples of reversal, with
the biggest one, the catastrophe, coming just before the end of a classically constructed drama, and having, we hope, the cathartic effect
that Aristotle recommended.

POLARITY
6. RECOGNITION
In the ancient world a favorite device for bringing about an emotionally charged reversal was a recognition scene, in which the disguised
identity or secret relationship of a character is revealed, and the fortunes of the characters are reversed. These are scenes where long-lost
lovers are united, where cruel tyrants realize they are about to execute
their own sons, where the masked superheroes are unveiled, where
the Prince puts the glass slipper on Cinderella’s foot and realizes she’s
the girl of his dreams. A mainstay of Robin Hood movies is a scene
where King Richard, who has been creeping around England in disguise to see what's been going on in his absence, throws off his outer
robe to reveal the rampant lions on his surcoat. Robin and all his men
instantly recognize him as the King, falling to their knees in reverent awe. It represents a moment in the story when the tide decisively
has turned.
A recognition scene makes a good climactic reversal when a character has been going around in disguise, like Tootsie or Mrs. Doubtfire.
Often it represents the catastrophe of unmasking that the hero has
dreaded but it also is the opportunity for emotional honesty and selfacceptance. That the apparent disaster turns out to be the means of
dramatic fulfillment makes for a double reversal.
7. ROMANTIC REVERSALS
A kind of current, like magnetic current or electric current, flows
through the invisible lines that connect characters in stories and
people in relationships. We feel a certain flow of energy with some
people and want to be with them, and we can sense when the flow of
energy is strangled, blocked, reversed, or completely cut off. We know
when there is “good chemistry” or a “spark” between two actors in
a romance, two buddies in a comedy, or two rivals in an adventure,
and are disappointed when there isn’t enough current flowing in a
relationship. We feel something when the polarity of a friendship or
393
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
romance reverses itself, flipping from a strong force of attraction to
one of repulsion.
In stories of romance the two lovers may go through several
cycles of reversal, alternating between attraction and repulsion or
trust and suspicion, as in Hitchcock’s romantic spy thrillers North
by Northwest and Notorious, or movies like Body Heat, Casino, Fatal
Attraction, etc. The romance may begin with attraction, based on
noticing superficially similar tastes or sensing that the other person
can supply the elements missing from one’s personality. We perversely enjoy watching the reversal of this situation, as the lovers
inevitably discover their partners are quite different than they first
appeared and are temporarily driven apart. After several reversals of
attraction and repulsion, the lovers usually end up in alignment, the
forces within them lined up in harmonious energy that promotes
their connectedness, unless of course you are portraying a tragic,
doomed love affair.
On the other hand a love story might begin with initial repulsion and mistrust, which will gradually reverse itself to attraction as
the lovers overcome their differences and discover common ground,
although there may be several reversals of polarity and episodes of
attraction and repulsion along the way.
8. POLARITY AND THE CHARACTER ARC
One of the dependable polarized plot forms is the genre of buddy
comedy/adventure, in which two mismatched heroes go through a
two-tiered adventure together. On one level, the outer dimension,
they are cops, spies, or ordinary people battling some external enemy,
creating a polarized struggle between good and evil. But on another
level, an inner or emotional dimension, they are in a polarized relationship with one another, usually turning on a sharp contrast in
their lifestyles, philosophies, or background. They may want the same
overall, external goal, but they go about it in wildly contrasting ways,
394:
POLARITY
generating conflict, drama, suspense, and humor through polarity.
Examples include Trading Places, the Lethal Weapon series, Zoolander, the Rush Hour movies, etc.
These stories became formulaic in the 1980s and ’90s, where I
read a lot of them that studios like Disney and Fox were considering.
However predictable they became, they were a fascinating laboratory
for studying the myriad ways that writers deal with the kind of story
they call a “two-hander,’ one that has two protagonists or heroes but
in a polarized, antagonistic relationship with another.
The first written story we know of, the epic of Gilgamesh, is
the prototype for all polarized buddy adventures to follow. A playboy king, Gilgamesh, is so out of control that his people pray to the
gods to send someone to distract him. They send him a real challenge in the form of a huge wild man of the forest, Enkidu. They
battle at first, become good friends, battle monsters together, and
fully explore the polarity of two different kinds of manhood. The
adventure takes a tragic and more noble turn at the death of Enkidu,
which sends Gilgamesh on a spiritual quest for the elusive secret of
immortality.
A polarized relationship, be it a friendship, partnership, alliance,
or romance, allows for a full exploration of character as the two people, representing opposite ends of a spectrum of behavior, find their
standards and habits intensely challenged by energy that is just the
opposite of theirs, perhaps outgoing where theirs is shy and private,
or highly organized where their lives are chaotic. Here is a partial list
of possible polarities within a relationship. Entire stories could be
built around each of these pairs of opposites. I’m sure you can think
of many more.

THE DOCTRINE OF CHANGE
A polarized relationship of opposites may temporarily reach a state
of equilibrium or balance, but most polarized systems don’t stay balanced for very long. Energy is always flowing, creating change. One
side of the polarity exerts force on the other. When a situation is
extremely polarized, when the two sides have been driven out to their
POLARITY
most extreme positions, there is a tendency for the polarity to reverse
itself. According to the ancient Chinese philosophy of the I Ching,
the doctrine of changes, things are always in the process of flowing
into their opposites. Extreme idealists can turn into cynics, passionate lovers into cold-hearted haters. Abject cowards have the sleeping
potential to become heroes, and many saints began as great sinners.
This eternally changing feature of reality is described by the Taoist
symbol of Yin and Yang, the two comma shapes flowing into one
another, each with the seed of its opposite deep in its center.
The more polarized a system is, the more likely it is to reverse its
polarity. This can happen little by little, in graduated stages, or it can
come about catastrophically and all at once. Under the stimulus of
conflict with a polarized opposite, a character will begin to oscillate,
to swing like a pendulum, further away from the opposite at times,
closer at other times. If the stimulus is continued to a certain tipping
point, the character may flip polarity, and become temporarily aligned
with the opposite pole.
The shy person, impacted repeatedly by an outgoing person,
will retreat and advance, but if the stimulus continues, he or she will
make a comical or dramatic reversal to experiment with the unfamiliar experience of being confident and highly social. Movies like The
Nutty Professor or As Good As It Gets use this technique to explore the
extremes of behavior and show us characters gradually and then drastically reversing their polarity.
The reversal may be almost imperceptible at first, trickling bit
by bit like grains of sand in an hourglass. For example, in the classic screwball comedy Topper, a man who has been rigid, disciplined,
and meek his entire life enters into a polarized relationship with two
playful ghosts, the Kirbys, who are loose, free, and rebellious. At first
Cosmo Topper is driven to even greater rigidity to counteract the
wild energy of the Kirbys. But this extreme position is unnatural and
inherently unstable. Under continued challenge from the Kirbys,
397
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Topper experiments tentatively with the free, loose behavior of his
polar opposites, then retreats to comfortable rigidity, repeating the
process several times until reaching a tipping point where he can no
longer resist, and gives himself over completely to their madcap strategy for living, totally reversing his polarity. In the end, he reverts to
something like his old, meek behavior, but now has access to his freer
side and is happier for it.
Sometimes, however, the reversal of polarity happens early in
the story and all at once, in a catastrophic collapse of the effort to
maintain an extreme, polarized position. In Fargo, William Macy's
character topples a lifetime of following the rules by reversing polarity to become the planner of a kidnapping that goes disastrously awry.
Liar, Liar shows us a man who has lied to everyone and kidded himself his entire life suddenly forced to tell the truth in all circumstances
thanks to the powerful birthday wish of his sincere and honest son.
In both cases we see the characters torn between their old polar positions and catastrophic new conditions that place them abruptly at the
opposite end of the spectrum.
9. THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM
When a character goes through a reversal of polarity, what happens to
his or her partner in the polarized relationship? Some of these partners exist only to catalyze change in a main character, and will not
change much themselves. The Kirbys in Topper aren’t going to suddenly turn into spineless weaklings like Cosmo Topper had been. But
they may shift their point of view a little, realizing they've been too
hard on him or that their meddling has caused him problems that they
have to solve. When a character reverses polarity, the laws of polarity
suggest that there be some reciprocal movement from the character
or force at the opposite pole.
When Character A makes a seismic polarity shift, Character Z
at the other end of the spectrum in the relationship may also take a
398
POLARITY
little vacation from his or her comfort zone, or may be driven to a
complete reversal himself. It can become uncomfortably crowded at
one pole if both people in the relationship are suddenly expressing
the same kind of energy.
If Character Z has been habitually lazy, and has come to depend
on a habitually energetic Character A to do all the work, it can be
alarming when the energetic A suddenly decides to experiment with
laziness. No one is left to do the work. and Z, who is lazy by nature,
may be forced into the unfamiliar role of the worker, with potentially comic results. In movies like Trading Places, characters get to
walk in each other’s shoes, experiencing unfamiliar worlds, undergoing temporary reversals, and experimenting with unfamiliar behavior.
Analyze This is built around two characters reversing polarity in opposite directions, as Robert De Niro’s gangster character discovers his
softer side and the habitually soft psychiatrist played by Billy Crystal
is forced to act like a tough guy to survive.
10. GOING TO EXTREMES
Experimenting with any polarized system involves going to the
extremes. Comedy or tragedy may result as people who have habitually leaned to one side of a polarity not only experiment with the
unaccustomed opposite quality, but take it to the limit. Those who
have been shy take new-found confidence too far, becoming obnoxious instead of suave or self-assured. They overcompensate, missing
the point of balance. They may then retreat to the opposite extreme of
sullenness or some other exaggerated form of their original behavior.
Eventually, through a series of such pendulum swings they may learn
a new way to behave, somewhere in the middle ground.
Learning how to handle any quality is a process of finding the
boundaries by experimentation. In many polarized relationships, one
person is more experienced and has already made a fool of himself
in long-ago experiments, so now he knows precisely how to handle
3)
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
women, cards, guns, cars, or money. To the inexperienced person it’s
all new, so we get to watch him or her making the beginner’s hilarious mistakes.
Often there is a reciprocal area where the experienced person is
weak, and is forced to make a comical effort to master the unaccustomed quality, such as politeness, sincerity, or compassion. However,
the more experienced person will likely not have as far to travel in his
or her path of learning as the inexperienced person.
11. REVERSAL OF THE REVERSAL
In effect the characters are learning from each other, shocked into it by
contact with someone who is a polar opposite in one or more dimensions of behavior. They reverse polarity in order to experiment with
behavior that is outside of their normal comfort zone. However, rarely
is this the end of the story. There is usually at least one more reversal,
as the characters recover from the temporary insanity imposed by the
story and return to their true natures. It is a very strong rule in drama,
and in life, that people remain true to their basic natures. They change,
and their change is essential for drama, but typically they only change
a little, taking a single step towards integrating a forgotten or rejected
quality into their natures.
Having learned something useful by their first reversal, they may
retreat to the pole that represents their true nature, but they end up in
a little different place from where they started. This is realistic character change, an incremental movement rather than a total 180-degree
reversal. Complete and permanent reversals of polarity are rare in
stories and in life.
Ifa story has done its work, the character has experimented with
something unfamiliar, realized that some special quality was lacking,
and incorporated some aspect of that quality into his or her life. He
or she returns to their general comfort zone, but to a more nearly
balanced position nearer the center, not polarized to either extreme.

In the process, the character and the audience get to experience
all points along the spectrum, both the extremes and a range of positions in between. In most cases it’s not desirable or realistic to end
up exactly in the middle of the two extreme positions. Most stories
end with the characters back more or less on the side of the polarity where they started, but several steps closer to the center and the
opposite side. The characters’ range of possible behavior now avoids
the extreme positions and overlaps a little into the territory of the
opposite side, producing a more balanced personality that leaves room
for the formerly unexpressed quality. This is a good place to end up,
because from this position the character can retreat to his or her old
comfort zone if threatened, but still reach across to experience something of the opposite side.
In the Chinese system known as the Book of Changes, this is
considered a more stable state, more desirable than extreme polarization. In a throw of three coins, two heads and a tail or two tails
and a head symbolizes a stable, more balanced and realistic situation,
whereas a throw of three heads or three tails represents a situation that
is too polarized, too much of one thing, and must certainly collapse
or reverse polarity soon, becoming its opposite.
Any character who begins at an extreme or is driven to it is ripe
for a process of polarity reversal.
12. POLARITY SEEKS RESOLUTION
Sometimes the two big ideas or lifeways that have been polarized
throughout a story will seek resolution by converting into something else, a third way that resolves the contradiction between the
two elements.
The classic Western Red River shows two ways of living sharply
polarized in the form of the older and younger men played by John
Wayne (Tom Dunson) and Montgomery Clift (Matthew Garth).
Dunson is brave but bull-headed, masculinity taken to its most macho
402
POLARITY
extreme, while Garth’s softer style is radically different, merciful where
Dunson is ruthless. It is an almost Biblical polarity, like the difference
between the wrathful, jealous Old Testament God and the gentle,
compassionate Son of God depicted in the New Testament. Their
struggle turns deadly, with Dunson swearing he will hunt down and
kill Garth, who has been like a son to him. They fight at the climax
and it looks like the polarity can only be resolved by the death of
one party or the other, but this tragic fate is avoided by the intervention of pure female energy. Tess Millay, the young woman played by
Joanne Dru, breaks up the fight with a gunshot and reminds the men
that “anyone can see you two love each other.” The men realize she’s
right and stop fighting. Dunson declares he’ll change his cattle brand
to reflect his acceptance of Garth, and the polarity is resolved. The
two opposing styles of living are resolved into a third way, one that
balances Dunson’s extreme masculinity with feminine emotion and
compassion. It makes dramatic sense, for it was Dunson’s rejection of
the feminine side in the early part of the film that set the whole plot
in motion, when Dunson refused to take his lady love along with him
on his journey to Texas.
We could say the protagonist’s point of view or style of living
is the thesis of the story. The anti-thesis is the antagonist’s opposing
viewpoint and style. The synthesis is whatever resolves the polarized
conflict at the end. It may be a restatement of the protagonist’s wishes
or world-view, incorporating new learning or strength gained from
the clash with the antagonist. It may be a radical new approach to life
that the hero finds, or it may be a return to the hero’s original position, but even then it will always be shifted a little by the polarized
struggle the hero has been through. Typically heroes learn something
from their polar opposites and incorporate this into their new pattern of behavior.
The resolution of some polarized stories could be the realization
that the polarization itself was false, based on a misunderstanding,
403
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
or that it was totally unnecessary if the seemingly opposed parties had simply communicated better in the beginning. Polarized
romances can be built entirely around misunderstandings to show
the difficulty of communication in the arena of love, but might
end with the lovers realizing they had been saying the same thing
all along.
13. POLARIZED UNIVERSES
Polarity is a meta-pattern, a system that operates at all levels in stories,
from large-scale clashes of cultures to intimate human relationships,
all the way down to polarities within individuals. On the big scale a
story can show a polarized clash between two cultures, generations,
world-views, or philosophies of life. Ancient myths were polarized by
eternal struggles between gods and giants or between primordial elements like fire and ice. Most Westerns put the hero into a town or a
situation that is sharply polarized between pairs of opposing forces:
Indians versus the cavalry, cattle barons versus immigrant farmers,
ex-Confederates versus ex-Yankees, etc. Film noir and the genre of
“cops-and-robbers” split the world into polarized levels, the sun-lit
upper world of law-abiding society and the shadowed Underworld
of the criminals. The movie Titanic is polarized between the worlds
of upper and lower decks, representing the classes of society and
the conflict between desire for control and desire for freedom. The
Terminator and Matrix movies are polarized between humans and
machines, the Star Wars movies between dark and light sides of the
Force. Platoon is polarized by a young soldier’s choice between brutal
and humane ways of going through a war, represented by two older
men with contrasting approaches to survival.
14. INNER POLARITY
A story can be built around the polarities that sometimes exist within
a person, as explored in stories and movies like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
404
POLARITY
and Fight Club. Psycho shows us a man who has internalized the feminine side of his dead mother, and half the time speaks in her voice.
Stories like these externalize and make visible the usually unseen dualities of personality.
There is no better dramatization of a polarized inner struggle
than the chilling scene in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,
where Gollum alternates between the good and evil sides of his own
personality. The good side is what remains of his original identity as an
innocent hobbit, Smeagol, and it resists temptation heroically, remembering the kindness and humanity shown by his master, Frodo. But
eventually the wheedling, crafty, evil side that has degenerated into
Gollum triumphs with fierce hate and jealousy, reversing the power
balance within the character. The polarity of the character had been
aligned towards hope for Gollum’s salvation; now it is aligned to the
certainty that he will betray the hobbits in his greed to have the Ring.
Polarity was used here to show an inner struggle in a divided self.
15. AGON
Around the globe, people have imagined the creation of the world as
a polarized situation. God divides light from darkness and the heavens from the earth. Primordial gods wrestled monsters of chaos in the
earliest stories of creation, and the earliest dramas were religious rituals re-enacting these polarized struggles. In the ancient world, where
abstract qualities such as luck, love, war, and victory were personified,
humanized, and worshipped as gods, the potent force of polarity was
recognized in the person of the Greek god Agon, the force of struggle
and conflict, ruling over athletic events and contests of all kinds, even
legal disputes, for agon also means a judgment. In an athletic event
or a courtroom, a judgment is being made about who is the best or
who is right.
Agon was pictured as a young athlete carrying a pair of jumping
weights called “halteres” in his hands. The weights gave the jumper an
405
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
extra boost on long jumps and may have been a symbol of some quality associated with Agon, perhaps an extra edge he gave to the athlete
who prayed and offered sacrifice to him. There was an altar of sacrifice
dedicated to Agon at Olympia, where the Olympic games were held.
Not much is known about Agon or his “backstory” but he may have
been part of a family of Zeus’s children who were responsible for other
qualities that had roles to play in the lives of athletes, such as speed,
victory, competitive spirit, and even chaos.
The spirit of Agon is imbedded in the polarized terms “protagonist” and “antagonist.” We cheer for the protagonist in the struggle or
contest, and we wish for the defeat of the antagonist.
The English word “agony” derives from agon and signifies that
the process of struggle is sometimes painful and arduous. The word
is sometimes used as one pole of a polarized expression, as in the title
The Agony and the Ecstasy or the phrase from TV coverage of the
Olympic Games, “the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat.” These
phrases describe the dramatic emotional extremes that a polarized
agon can generate. To antagonize someone is to create an agon or
conflict with that person where none existed before.
AGON: THE ARGUMENT OF THE PLAY
In ancient Greek drama, the “agon” was a formal debate between two
characters in which their contrasting views of a current public issue
were presented, judged by a chorus. We could still find use for the
word to describe the main philosophical debate or clash of lifestyles
in a play, novel, or film script. Movies like Wall Street and_A Few Good
Men and TV shows like The West Wing dramatize an agon, a kind of
debate about a current social issue.
MODERN-DAY PUBLIC AGON
An “agon” among the Greeks and Romans also meant a formal competition to determine who was best at a given skill such as singing,
406
POLARITY
composing plays or music, delivering speeches, etc. As in our modern
star system of awards, prizes were given for the best performances of
the year. These “agonic” competitions were organized like our sports
leagues, with local and regional competitions leading to a national
contest held at a great yearly festival in the capital. We still have a
strong need to arrange this kind of agon each year to determine
which team or performer is the best in the region, the country, and
the world. Each stage of our athletic system pits pairs of teams and
individuals against each other, re-creating the polarized agon time
after time until there are only two teams or people left for the final
contest. Agon thrives in the eternally popular game shows and competitive “reality” programs of the day.
THE PERSONAL AGON
At the personal level, an agon was any challenge that pitted one
side of a person’s makeup against another. For example, the mind is
always trying to master the lazy tendencies of the body. The struggle of the artist with her work is an agon, pitting her will to bring
creativity into form against all the forces that make it difficult. Or
the agon can be a person’s struggle with some external condition
that makes life challenging, such as a birth defect, an accident, or
an injustice.
All the entertainment of the ancient world was based on the
polarizing principle of the agon, and it seems to have an almost
magnetic effect on us even today, in our sports, in politics, and in
entertainment.
16. POLARITY GIVES ORIENTATION
Magnets are widely used for purposes of orientation. A magnetic compass automatically orientates itself to point north, and from this we
can determine south, east, west, and all points in between. Polarity in
a story serves a similar function, giving the audience orientation about
407
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
the characters and situation, from the simplest level of white hats and
black hats to represent good guys and bad guys, to the most sophisticated psychological dramas. Polarity lets us know who has the power
and suggests how it might shift. It signals us who we are to be aligned
with in the story and helps us understand how all the characters and
situations are aligned with one force or the other.
Most of the time, you have to play fair with the audience and not
make it difficult for them to get their bearings in a story. A polarized
town, family, or society, a polarized agon between contrasting opponents, a polarized personality about to reverse itself, all these can help
the audience determine what is up and down, right and wrong, in
this story. They can quickly align themselves for or against characters
depending on their choices about the polarized condition in the story.
The writer can then start sending positive or negative energy into the
scenes, bringing temporary victory or defeat to the characters until
the final resolution.
Of course, some stories deal precisely with the grey areas, the
kinds of characters and situations that are remarkable and interesting
because they aren’t obviously polarized. Some artists don’t want to
take sides or push their characters into simplistic categories. There is
room for this artistic approach, but polarities will still naturally arise
simply from having two characters in the same room at the same time.
CONCLUSION
As noted, polarities are useful tools in stories and are a practical way of
organizing reality, but they can be misused to oversimplify situations
that may actually be quite complex. Audiences are sophisticated these
days and while they enjoy stories that are strongly polarized, they
enjoy them more when they are also nuanced with small shadings and
contradictions that make stories and characters seem realistic, even
when dealing in worlds of pure fantasy. Like any technique, polarization in a story can be heavy-handed and too obvious. Polarization
408
POLARITY
without shading or the possibility of change would quickly become
boring, just two people shouting at each other. The fun is in seeing a
tiny seed of the opposite quality coming to life in a polarized character or situation. It may only come to life for an instant, showing the
possibility of reversal but then snatching it away forever, or it may
work its way slowly until the character or situation reverses polarity
dramatically.
Polarities in politics, sports, war, or relationships can divide us,
but they also have the possibility of uniting us when we have been
through a struggle together. An old soldier may have more in common with his former enemies than he does with his grandchildren.
Polarized family feuds will sometimes dissolve when after many years
neither party can remember what all the fighting was about.
Polarities in stories form a conceptual framework with which to
organize ideas and energy, building up positive and negative charges
around selected characters, words, and concepts. They may serve a
survival function for us in dramatizing useful distinctions about
behavior, and in identifying patterns in human relationships. They
serve an essential dramatic function by stirring us up, triggering
emotional involvement and physical reactions in the organs of our
bodies. Words on a page, actors on a stage, images on a screen can
pull us this way and that until we have a small but potentially significant emotional release, for when we laugh at the characters in
a funny movie, we are laughing in part at ourselves. When we cry
over the fate of the characters in a tragedy or a romance, we cry in
part for ourselves. When we shudder in terror at the latest horror
film or novel, we shudder for ourselves. We sense our part in the
great polarities, spirit and matter, male and female, life and death,
good and evil, and we find healthy release in stories that explore
their workings.

QUESTIONS
. “To be or not to be, that is the question.” Shakespeare uses many
dualities and polarities in his plays and sonnets, using twins, pairs
of lovers, and contrasting ideas such as the relationship of Prince
Hal and Sir John Falstaff in Henry IV parts one and two, where

Were gonna find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out.”
— J.J. Cale, “After Midnight”
everal times in this book we have used the word
catharsis, referring to a concept found in the
works of Aristotle, one of his terms that has survived to become part of the general theory of
drama and narrative. It is a critical concept, the
point of drama according to Aristotle, and its roots go back to the
beginnings of language, art, and ritual.
We have little chance of ever knowing for sure what Aristotle
meant by catharsis. His work has come down to us in shreds. Less
than half of what he wrote survives and most of that comes from rotted, jumbled manuscripts found under a building. Scholars disagree
vigorously about what Aristotle meant by catharsis and there is even
a theory that the word was inserted into the Poetics by an overeager
copyist at a place where the text was garbled, because Aristotle had
promised in an earlier book that he would eventually get around to
defining catharsis.
413
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Whatever it meant to Aristotle, the word has come to mean
something to us: a sudden release of emotions that can be brought
about by good entertainment, great art, or probing for psychological
insight. Its roots are deep in our spirits and in the history of our species. If we look back a little into the origins of drama, we might find
that catharsis has always been a desired effect and in fact is the mainspring of the dramatic experience.
To find the origins of drama, narrative, art, religion, and philosophy we have to cast our minds back to the time when human beings
were in their earliest stages of development. Through a few miracles of
preservation, we have windows into the soul of those times, through the
marvelous cave paintings and sculptures that have survived from as early
as forty thousand years ago. We know from these breathtaking, life-like
renderings of animals and hunters that the people of those times made
pilgrimages deep into the belly of the earth, and must have performed
some rituals in which they played the parts of the animals they hunted
or the forces of nature that they perceived around them. Through these
rituals, the beginnings of storytelling and drama, they must have tried to
master or appease these powers. Joseph Campbell, studying prehistoric
paintings from the Les Trois Freres cave in France, recognized one figure in an antlered costume as a shaman, a go-between, embodying the
spirit of the animals his people depended on for life.
A physical catharsis or emotional reaction is hard to avoid when
going into a deep cave, even today. If you go as they went, long ago, with
only fitful candles to light your way down the narrow tunnels, you can’t
help but feel the weight of the earth and imagine the forces and beings
that might be lurking there in the endless darkness just outside the glow
of your flame. There is still a sense of wonder when coming out into a
big cavern deep in the earth, especially when its walls are painted with
huge animals that seem to leap across the ceiling in the flickering candle
light. It would be a perfect stage to initiate young people into the mysteries of the tribe, its deepest beliefs, the essence of its compact with nature.
414
CATHARSIS
I can testify to the still-impressive power of a candle in a dark
place to animate things. It is the cheapest but most effective of special effects. I was visiting Hamlet’s castle at Elsinore, or Helsingor as
the Danes call it, on a tip of Denmark, facing Sweden across a short
expanse of water. In the frigid crypts of the castle is kept a brooding statue of Denmark’s version of King Arthur or El Cid, shown as
a rugged Viking sitting on his throne with a drawn sword across his
knees. He is Holger Danske, Ogier the Dane, one of Charlemagne’s
paladins and Denmark’s legendary protector in time of need. Troops
of tourists and schoolchildren are marched into the vaulted chamber
to stand shivering before the statue, marveling at the illusion of life,
for at its feet is a candle, or rather these days an electric imitation of
a candle, a small flickering light. In the otherwise darkened crypt, so
like a cave, the erratic light casts a nervous glow over the statue’s features, and shadows dance and shift on the chamber walls. In an eerie
way that makes the hair stand up on your arms and the back of your
neck, the stone image seems to your eyes and your Stone Age nervous
system to be distinctly alive. You could swear the Viking chieftain is
asleep but breathing, about to wake up and surge off his pedestal at
any moment. It makes a convincing theatrical illusion that the country’s eternal fighting spirit is stumbering but ready to return to action
when needed. No doubt the ancient people felt the same awe as flickering torches and oil lamps made the giant horses and bison gallop
across the cave walls.
A feature of some commercial cave tours in the modern world
is to turn off the electric lights at some point so the visitors can get a
sense of the pure blackness of the lightless cave. Perhaps our ancestors
used a similar dramatic technique in their cave rituals, putting out the
oil lamps and torches so the young initiates could experience the deep
dark. For some it would be terrifying, for others, soul-expanding, and
some might be visited with visions that made them feel connected to
the animals or the powers that made the world. Perhaps the paintings
415
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
are memorials of those visions, amended and painted over by successive generations of initiates.
Emerging from a cave is another hazardous passage, climaxed
with the feeling of relief upon emerging into sunlight and open
space once again. For some there is a feeling of transformation, of
having died in some sense down there, or having come very close
to death and other eternal forces, and now coming to new life on
the surface.
Ancient people undoubtedly had other places that served a similar function of enhancing dramatic experiences and evoking a religious
feeling, such as intimate groves of trees, natural amphitheaters, isolated mountain tops like Mt. Olympus, sacred wells and fountains, or
arrangements of monumental stones. Trees could be planted in rows
or in circles to create spaces that enhanced a group feeling of awe and
connection with greater forces. In those spaces rituals were performed
that tried to link the world of people to the world of the gods. People
played the parts of gods, heroes, and monsters to enact the drama of
creation and the stories of the ancestors. The first plays may have been
the texts of these rituals, recited at first by a chorus but with actors
gradually taking the parts of individual characters.
As humans made the transition from nomadic hunting to the
settled life of farmers in societies like those of Egypt, Mesopotamia,
and the Indus Valley, drama found different theatres of expression
and dramatic forms, with a new emphasis on time and the vast calendar of the stars.
On the fertile, muddy plains on the banks of great rivers, people built civilizations that needed dramatic rituals to bring order,
unity, and a shared sense of purpose to a large population. By communal effort they fashioned river mud into bricks and built huge
temple mounds that were like artificial mountains, connecting
their society to the heavens and providing a stairway to the world
of the gods.
416
CATHARSIS
These temple pyramids or ziggurats also served as spectacular
backdrops for highly theatrical presentations designed to evoke a
healthy religious feeling in a whole population.
These religious spectacles were staged with exquisite precision
to a calendar set by a giant celestial clock, the movement of the sun,
moon, and stars across the sky. Lives were short but people accumulated thousands of years of observations that could be passed down
by various forms of notation. They paid particularly close attention to
the exact turning points of the year — the spring and fall equinoxes
and the summer and winter solstices — the four points marking the
change of season. The great festivals of the year were held at these
times, with a greater festival marking the beginning of the New Year.
Their interest in the cycles of time was practical, a life and death
matter. A delay of as little as a few days in planting or harvesting
could mean that a crop would fail and there would be nothing to eat
through the winter, dooming most to die. Even in earlier times the
hunters knew that the movements of the animals and the fruiting of
the trees follow the celestial calendar.
The dramatic meat of these seasonal turning point festivals was
the staging of an elaborate adventure, in which the king or the statues
of the gods “disappeared,” supposedly having been kidnapped, stolen
away, or killed and dismembered by dark forces of chaos. The whole
society pretended to mourn them, giving up the pleasures of life for a
period of time in sympathy with the kidnapped or dead gods or king.
In some versions of seasonal festivals in ancient Babylon, the statues of the gods were actually removed from the temples and buried in
the desert or destroyed. Later in the festival they would be returned
to their rightful positions or replaced with new ones, triggering great
relief and celebration by the people.
Sir James Frazer in The Golden Bough persuasively makes the
case that many societies pass through an early stage where the office
of king is a temporary job, held only for a set period of time, perhaps
417
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
just one year. In the most primal of these societies the old king is
either executed or must fight a ritual combat with the new candidate.
The sacrificial death of the old king cleans the slate and pays for the
mistakes of the past year. Gradually, popular or very powerful kings
managed to extend their rule but the tradition of sacrificing the old
king ran very deep and was often represented symbolically in the customs, traditions, and ritual pageants of the mound-building cultures.
The literal sacrifice of the king and his replacement with a successor
was replaced by a mythological death and rebirth, like that of Osiris.
The king was identified with the god who had died and come back
to life again, and acted out his death, dismemberment, and rebirth in
dramatic rituals rather than by actually dying.
The scholar Theodor Gaster described four types of ritual in
the ancient world of the Near East that followed one another in a
seasonal sequence of Mortification, Purgation, Invigoration, and
Jubilation, all related to the death and rebirth of the god or king.
Sometimes all four elements could be combined in an elaborate
ritual drama that involved all the members of society as actors in
the play, whose stage was the whole city, and whose subject was the
death and rebirth of the god-king. Gaster says ancient ritual drama
was of two types, rituals of kenosis or emptying, and rituals of plerosis or filling. Mortification and Purgation emptied the body and
mind, cleansing and purifying them while giving a taste of death,
and Invigoration and Jubilation rituals filled and satisfied the people
while re-invoking the principle of life.
Performing these rituals at the seasonal turning points was a symbolic but also practical way of allowing the whole society to cool down
after a strenuous season of work. As we now grant ourselves frequent
holidays to punctuate the year and break our work into manageable,
bearable spans of time, so did our ancestors sensibly stop the drumbeat of the work routine from time to time, but very consciously and
purposefully.
418
CATHARSIS
In the Mortification and Purgation phases they shut down as
many of life’s systems as possible, using mourning for the absent gods
or king as a pretext to give a rest to all commerce, labor, lawsuits, etc.
Shops, warehouses, and factories were closed. The hearth fires that
burned in every home were put out, and the great fire that burned
eternally in the temple was extinguished too. Even the processes of the
body were shut down, and people fasted, stopped talking, and gave
up life’s pleasures to become more quiet and contemplative for a few
hours. It was considered a time out, time outside of time, a grinding
down of the giant clock, and in some calendars the festival days were
not given numbers or names, signifying that this was sacred turning
point time, not subject to the ordinary daily rhythms.
Mortification meant bringing the body near the point of death by
fasting, but also denying oneself any of the little pleasures of the body.
They believed the body needed to be humbled or mortified from time
to time, so it knows the mind is the master. The absence of things that
were normally taken for granted created a renewed appreciation for
them. It also focused the minds of the people and reminded them of
the possibility of death that was always near.
Lamentation was an important part of the ritual at this point.
People were supposed to meditate sympathetically on the death of
the hero-god-king until the tears ran down their faces. Special songs
were composed with the aim of triggering the emotions of grief and
sorrow. The dramatic form of tragedy was developed from the rituals,
chants, and dances of mourning that tried to evoke sympathy for the
suffering god or king. Tragedy comes from the word “tragos” or goat,
because goats were often used as sacrificial stand-ins for the yearly sacrifice of the king.
The Purgation phase of seasonal rituals was marked by cleansing the body and the environment as much as possible. People would
bathe and anoint themselves with oil to symbolize the shedding of
an old skin from the previous season. Houses and temples would be
419
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
cleansed with water and fumigated. Bells and gongs would be rung
to chase out unclean spirits. Fireworks have been used in China for
centuries for this purpose.
Purgation was both metaphorical and literal in these ancient societies. Mentally and metaphorically, people were supposed to purge
themselves of sour feelings, resentments, jealousies, and so on. But
they were also supposed to cleanse the body of impurities by fasting
and even by inducing vomiting.
Catharsis was a medical term in Aristotle’s time for the natural processes by which the body eliminates poisons and wastes. It
comes from the word “katharos,’ which means pure, so a catharsis is
a purification, but it can also be a purgation, a vomiting up or violent
expelling of impurities. Sneezing is a cathartic reaction to rid the nasal
passages of impurities.
In the Poetics, Aristotle used the term “catharsis of the emotions”
as a metaphor, comparing the emotional effect of a drama with the
way the body rids itself of toxins and impurities. The Greeks and other
ancient peoples knew that life is hard, involving many unpleasant
compromises and the eating of much crow. Emotional impurities and
poisons build up in the body just as physical ones do, and can have catastrophic effects if not purged at regular intervals. They believed that
people who get no emotional release from art, music, sports, dance,
or drama inevitably will be overcome by poisonous feelings that will
surface as aggression, hostility, perversion, or madness, all things dangerous to the society. Therefore they institutionalized purging and
purification of mind and body with seasonal festivals that artificially
induced catharsis on a quarterly schedule. Drama was a sacred thing,
not available for daily consumption, and confined only to the important turning points of the year.
The fasting and purging created a condition of extreme dramatic suggestibility in the population. It was then that the whole
society gathered in the squares and streets of the city-state to witness a
420
CATHARSIS
spectacular dramatization of some great event in the mythic history of
the culture. The people were not a passive audience, but took an active
part in the dramatic presentation. The city itself with its gates, processional avenues, and towering temples became the stage set for an
enormous collective re-enactment of creation, a great battle between
gods of order and chaos, or the death and rebirth of the god-king.
The Greeks adopted the general patterns of these seasonal dramatic rituals and made them part of their yearly calendar of religious
festivals, built around the doings of gods like Apollo and Dionysus.
The great Greek tragedies and comedies evolved slowly from ritual
re-enactments and recitations of poems about the gods and heroes,
and originally were conceived as religious ceremonies, sacramental
acts designed to have a beneficial effect on the spirit. The magnificent
outdoor theatres of ancient Greece were originally built as temples
dedicated to the god Dionysus, one of the dying and rising gods. The
plays enacted there were intended as the dramatic climax to vast religious pageants, and they were carefully designed to bring about the
emotional effect that Aristotle called catharsis, a feeling of pity and
fear evoked by watching the unfolding fate of a hero. The hero of a
Greek tragedy was a stand-in for the old god-king, undergoing a sacrificial death on behalf of all the members of the society, and bringing
about a catharsis in the members of the audience through sympathy
with his or her sufferings.
In Athens, along with dramatic rituals honoring Apollo and Dionysus, seasonal festivals were organized around the myth of Demeter
and Kore (Persephone), a primal mother and daughter who once
ruled over an endless summer of abundance. Their story tells how
the seasons began, and its festivals are timed to coincide with the
seasonal rhythms of planting, tending, harvesting, and surviving the
winter. Their drama’s Call to Adventure was the kidnapping of Persephone by Hades, lord of the Underworld. The rituals re-enacted her
kidnapping in October, at the Thesmophoria, three days of festivals
42]
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
exclusively for women. This was the emptying, introducing the time
of Mortification and Purgation.
In the myth, Demeter’s grief at the disappearance of her daughter brings about a terrible season in which the earth lies barren as
the goddess of the harvest neglects her duties in order to mourn and
search for her daughter. Demeter becomes the hero of an epic quest,
playing many roles as she seeks out her daughter in the Underworld
and induces the gods to make a deal with Hades to allow Persephone
to return to the world of light and life, at least for part of the year.
Kore/Persephone’s return was celebrated at festivals called the
Lesser Eleusinia in February, marking the return of spring.
Every five years, the Greater Eleusinia, the greatest festival in the
Greek calendar, was held in September. Some of the carvings from the
pediment of the Parthenon depict these jubilant ceremonies, when the
young horsemen of Athens would fetch the sacred objects from the
temple of Demeter and march them to a special shrine, the Eleusinion, at the base of the Acropolis. The story of Demeter and Kore was
acted out in secret ceremonies of great emotional impact for a select
group of initiates, using all the effects of lighting, music, dance, ritual,
and staging to bring about the desired catharsis.
Nowadays we may use the term catharsis more broadly to mean
any kind of emotional release or breakthrough. Catharsis was adopted
by the psychological community to describe a therapeutic process in
which repressed thoughts, fears, emotions, or memories are deliberately brought to consciousness, triggering an emotional release or
breakthrough that is supposed to relieve anxiety and relax tension.
Movies and stories as well as art and music can have a role to play in
triggering a psychologically healthy cathartic reaction.
THE CATHARSIS OF COMEDY
In the classical Greek system, it was recognized that balance is
needed in a dramatic presentation or else it can be overwhelming
422
CATHARSIS
and exhausting. They added comedies to the ritual line-up to relieve
the emotional intensity of the tearful tragedies with some cathartic
laughter for contrast.
Comedy belongs to the “plerosis” or filling up portion of the ritual cycle. Once emptying and purging have been fully experienced, it’s
time to fill up again with something healthy, tasty, and life-affirming
that stimulates Invigoration and Jubilation.
The word comedy comes from “komos” which means “the revels,” a wild party or orgy. Rituals of Invigoration in very ancient times
involved a big feast in which eating, drinking, and all kinds of merriment were encouraged, to make a vivid contrast with the somber
tone of the Mortification and Purgation rituals that preceded it. One
aspect of comedy is the stirring up of sexual urges. Greek comedy
often dealt with power struggles between men and women and celebrated sexuality with exaggerated costumes and situations. Freud
considered that there was a strong linkage between laughter and sexuality, and of course sex is a natural catharsis that relieves tension.
The Greeks thought two or three heavy doses of tragedy would
do a good job of mortifying and purging you, and a dose of comedy was just the right finish to a ritual cycle, sending you back into
the next season of the year refreshed, psychologically cleansed and
reborn, and cheerful. As they used to say in vaudeville, “Always leave
‘em laughing.”
RETURN OF THE LIGHT
A feature of the seasonal rituals in ancient times was the re-lighting of
the sacred fire in a central temple, symbolic of the victory of life over
death. The flame would then be passed from person to person, carrying home candles or small oil lamps from which the individual hearth
fires could be re-lit to Invigorate the culture. The hearth fire would be
used to cook a feast that was consumed as part of the Jubilation that
concluded the seasonal cycle.
423
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Some of these rituals survive in various ways around the world
today. I witnessed one remnant at a Greek Orthodox Easter service in
New York City. Part of the Lenten observations is to cover the beautiful painted statues and icons with purple cloths and put out the
candles for a time, symbolically evoking grief and lamentation over
Christ’s suffering, death, and burial. Then, at a moment symbolizing
the Resurrection, a large Paschal candle is lit in the darkened church.
In the Greek Orthodox church in New York, the congregants had
brought along small candles which they lit from the big one. At the
end of the service they exited the church, but the ritual went on as
the families walked home or got into their cars, carefully shielding
the flames from the wind, preserving the light of the new season to
kindle their own symbolic hearth fires in their homes, just as people
used to do thousands of years ago. In similar ceremonies in Jerusalem,
Greek pilgrims will even carry home the sacred flames on specially
chartered airplanes.
When we deal in drama or narrative today, we are building on
forty thousand years of tradition and experience. Humans have always
sought orientation and emotional release through drama. Although
our entertainment is more evenly distributed throughout the year, we
still partake of some of the seasonal ritual effect. New shows on television are typically launched in September, time of the fall equinox.
Going to movies with family at holiday times or watching holiday
films like It’s a Wonderful Life each year is an emotional tradition
for many people. Certain kinds of movies seem to be associated with
specific seasons. In general we like love stories and sport stories in the
spring and summer, while more thoughtful dramas tend to be released
in fall and winter. The winter solstice, roughly coinciding with the
Christmas and New Year’s holidays, is a good time to release big fantasy pictures, especially those that comprise trilogies that can be run
over successive year-end holidays. Summer is the time for the blockbusters and action pictures.
424
CATHARSIS
THE POWER OF THE SEASONS
We are not so conscious of the seasons these days since we are somewhat insulated from their effects, and most of us no longer live by the
rhythms of planting and harvesting. However, the seasons still have
their power over us, affecting our lives and our moods in ways both
obvious and subtle. The seasons of the year and seasonal holidays
can be useful to the writer, providing natural turning points, a measure of the passage of time, and distinct emotional associations. The
passage of a single season makes an effective time frame for a movie
(That Championship Season, Summer Catch) or a story’s four-movement structure could be built around the passage of the seasons (The
Four Seasons). A change of seasons in a story can signify a change in
the hero’s fortunes or mood. A story could be built around a character who is disastrously out of synch with the rhythm of the seasons.
In your writing, remember that the purpose of everything you're
doing is to bring about some kind of emotional reaction in your reader
or viewer. It may not always be the full-blown explosive reaction of
catharsis, but it should have its effect on the organs of the body, stimulating them through repeated blows of conflict and setback for your
hero. You are always raising and lowering the tension, pumping energy
into your story and characters until some kind of emotional release is
inevitable, in the form of laughter, tears, shudders, or a warm glow of
understanding. People still need catharsis, and a good story is one of
the most reliable and entertaining ways of bringing it about.

THE WISDOM OF THE BODY
ee
“There is more wisdom in your body
than in your deepest philosophy.”
— Friedrich Nietzsche
Ithough we use our minds to process and interpret stories, much is going on throughout the
rest of the body as we interact with a narrative.
We react to art and to stories about our fellow
creatures with the organs of our body. In fact
the whole body is involved, skin, nerves, blood, bones, and organs.
Joseph Campbell pointed out that the archetypes speak to us
directly through the organs, as if we were programmed to respond
chemically to certain symbolic stimuli. For example, big-eyed infants
of any species trigger a reaction of sympathy and protectiveness, or
cause us to say things like “How cute!” Puss-in-Boots from the Shrek
movies knows how to exploit this deep emotional trigger by making
his eyes huge when he wants sympathy. Emotions are complex processes, but on one level they are simple chemical reactions to stimuli
in our environment, a fact that storytellers have always used to get
their emotional effects.
429
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Certain images or tableaux have an automatic emotional impact on
us, felt in the organs of our bodies. A tableau isa figure or several figures
in a setting, enacting some primal scene that either affects us intuitively,
on an almost animal level, or that has become charged with emotion
because of long tradition. The Last Supper, images of the Madonna and
child, and the Pieta depicting Christ’s mother cradling her dead son’s
body are all emotionally loaded religious tableaux. Similar images with
equal force existed in earlier cultures, like the Egyptian goddess Hathor
nursing her child or Isis tenderly assembling the scattered pieces of her
dismembered husband Osiris. Images of beings in conflict, people in
combat or gods and heroes wrestling with monsters cause tension in
our stomachs as we identify with one or another of the combatants.
Images of protective or generous spirits (kindly grandmothers, angels,
Santa Claus) give us a warm feeling of comfort. Representations of sympathetic characters in physical torment evoke a physical response, as in
graphic medieval art depicting the Crucifixion and the martyrdoms of
various saints like St. Sebastian who was shot full of arrows.
Classical Greek drama used startling visceral effects on stage, like
Oedipus appearing with his eyes torn out, to elicit a strong reaction
in the bodies of the beholders. The language of Greek plays could be
bold and brutal, hammering at the audience with vivid word choices
that suggested violent blows and the spilling of blood. Often a bloody
act was committed off-stage, but described with stomach-wrenching
detail, or the shocking evidence was displayed in the form of bloodsoaked clothing or actors portraying corpses.
The Romans took this to extremes in their version of Greek theatre which became more degenerate and cruel as the Empire stumbled
to its death. Symbolic or simulated acts of violence were replaced by
real ones, with condemned criminals suffering the fate of the fictional
characters, literally bleeding and dying on stage to amuse the Roman
public. Gladiators stepped into plays to enact mythological combats
and actually fought to the death in the theatres.
430
THE WISDOM OF THE Bopy
In the late 1700s, the puppet character of Guignol was imported
from Lyons to Paris, where his brash, violent nature gave birth to
a whole wave of plays known as Grand Guignol, whose object was
to provide thrills of terror and shudders of horror with the realistic
depiction of torture, beheadings, dismemberments, and other insults
to the human body.
Observers of the first impact of moving pictures on the public remarked on the realism and physical power of the images on the
screen, causing audiences to jump back when a train approached or
flinch when a gun was pointed at them for the first time in The Great
Train Robbery.
In the 1950s and ’60s, Alfred Hitchcock was known for provoking
physical reactions in his audiences, and he was a master organist, playing
the viscera like a mighty Wurlitzer in tension-filled movies like Psycho,
The Birds, and Vertigo, but he was not alone, for all good directors know
instinctively how to use their tools to make us feel something, physically and emotionally. They employ everything in the toolbox — story,
characters, editing, lighting, costumes, music, set design, action, special effects, and psychology — to bring about physical responses such
as holding the breath in suspense, gasping in response to surprises, and
exhaling in relaxation when the on-screen tension is released. In fact, the
secret of drama may come down to control of the audience’s breathing,
for through the breath all the other organs of the body can be regulated.
In the 1970s the special effects—laden movies of Irwin Allen
(Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno) were heralded, and sometimes condemned, as a new wave of visceral entertainment, playing
to the body rather than the mind. With the arrival of the modern
special effects masters of the Spielberg and Lucas generation, movies were able to seduce the eye and the other organs of the body ever
more convincingly.
Along the way there have been many experiments to enhance
the physical effects of entertainment and drama, from the burning of
43]

incense at Greek rituals to modern technical marvels like 3D, IMAX,
and mechanized seats that vibrate in time to on-screen machine-gun
fire. In Roman theatres and stadia, the presence of gods could be suggested by sprays of perfumed vapor and showers of fragrant flower
petals. In the 1950s experiments were done with 3D, “smell-o-vision,’
and “Percepto,” an effect in theatres specially rigged for William Castle’s unique effort, The Tingler. Seats were wired with buzzers that
made them vibrate at supposedly shocking moments on screen, where
a creature was depicted attaching itself to people's spines.
THE BODY AS A GUIDE TO CRITIQUING
It’s not easy to critique your own writing work or that of others. It
can be hard to articulate what’s wrong, how the story made you feel,
what was lacking. Sometimes the best way to measure a story’s effect
and diagnose its problems is to ask “How did it make me feel — in
the organs of my body? Did I feel anything physical at all, or was I
just having mental processes that didn’t much involve anything but
the brain? Did it make my blood run cold? Did it make my toes curl
with horror or delight? Did it make my nervous system alert as if the
dangers the hero faces were actually threatening me?” If not, there
may be something missing, an appeal to the body, a physical threat,
an emotional tension.
As a professional evaluator of stories I became keenly attuned to
the emotional and physical effects a manuscript could have on me. I
came to depend on the wisdom of the body to determine the quality
of the story. If it was bad and boring, my body would grow leaden and
the pages would weigh a thousand pounds apiece. I knew it was bad
if, as my eyes scanned down the page, my head kept drooping and I
nodded off to sleep. The good ones, I noticed, the ones that ultimately
made good movies, had the opposite effect on my body. They woke me
up. The organs of my body came to life one by one. The body became
alert, light, and happy, squirting fluids into the pleasure centers of the
432
THE WISDOM OF THE Bopy
brain, “the proper pleasure” as Aristotle called it, of experiencing emotional and physical release through a well-told, cathartic tale.
As we watch a good movie or are engrossed in a good novel,
we actually go into an altered state of consciousness, with a measurable change in brain waves detectable by the tools of science. Perhaps
changes in the rhythm of the breath, combined with focusing the
attention on the imaginary world of the story, bring about this almost
hypnotic effect.
When I started critiquing screenplays and stories for a living, I
soon found that what I was really reporting was how they had triggered chemical reactions in the organs of my body. The organs squirt
fluids, all day long, as we react to various emotional and physical situations in our environment, and it’s no different when we watch a movie
or imagine scenes from a novel. When we are stressed or frightened,
our adrenal glands transmit a chemical jolt through the body, sending signals to increase the heart rate and pace of breathing. When we
are in shock from seeing traumatic or frightening things, our bodies
send messages to shut down certain processes to preserve a core of life
in an emergency.
The word “horror” derives from the Latin word for bristling and
reflects the body’s automatic reaction to uncanny events, things that
upset the normal order. Such sights trigger a physical reaction in the
skin of the arms that resembles the response to cold air. Tiny muscles
cause the hairs on the arms to stand up, a reaction called “horripilation,” that means “bristling hair” or hair standing on end. Horror is
hair-raising. Some scientists think this may be a survival from hairier
times in human history, when having your thick pelt of hair stand up
when threatened would make you look bigger and scarier, as many
animals will swell up or ruffle up their fur when facing threats.
A tip for designers of sensory experiences: A sudden blast of
chilly air can trigger a shuddering effect in audiences, especially if
they are keyed up for it by some emotional or musical manipulation.
433
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
The chill can trigger the graveyard shudder of fear or a more exalted
form of physical reaction, like awe, wonder, or spiritual rebirth.
The effect of shuddering, in which the muscles of the body, especially the arms and back, involuntarily ripple or spasm, is associated
with other emotional effects in addition to horror. Religious awe or
deep psychological insight can produce shudders that can be very
pleasurable, signs of grace, endorsement from the body of the rightness of a thought. A shiver of this kind in French is called a “frisson,’
and I noticed the phenomenon when I concentrated hard on working
out a story problem, especially when working collaboratively in open
discussion with other people. In the course of trying out different
ideas someone would say something that triggered a shiver of response
in me. I would feel a tingle passing down my spine, almost as if thousands of small pebbles were rolling down my spinal column. It felt the
way a rain stick sounds, one of those hollow wooden tubes with dried
peas inside that makes a sound like falling rain. Sometimes other people would feel it too, or feel something like it, because I could see their
bodies being jolted by it. The shiver ran round the room.
I learned to value those physical reactions because they were
telling me I was in the presence of something true and right, something beautiful. In these story sessions, sometimes the answer to a
story problem rang true, on many levels of my being, sending a subtle physical signal that elements were lining up to create a desirable
emotional outcome, or that the story would now make better sense
or be more realistic or funnier. It suggested to me that there is an
inner grid of rightness about art and emotion, and that our bodies
respond with pleasure when we make works that line up with this
grid, allowing emotional energy to flow at full power like electrical
current. Solutions to story problems can have a certain beauty or elegance, as theories of physics or mathematical solutions are said to be
elegant. Perhaps we sense that the solution is in harmony with some
universal truth, some essential reality in the universe.
434
THE WISDOM OF THE Bopy
In evaluating story material for the Hollywood studios, I began to
think about how modern entertainment plays upon the various emotional and physical centers of the body, and observed that good stories
affected me in at least two organs at once, perhaps getting my heart
racing with tension while making my throat choke up with sympathy
for the death of a character. I needed to tear up, choke up, freeze up,
or laugh it up, and the more of those physical reactions I felt, the better the story was. Ideally perhaps, all the organs of the body should be
stimulated by a good story in the course of exploring all the possibilities
of an emotional situation. My motto as a story evaluator became, “If it
isn’t making at least two organs of my body squirt fluids, it’s no good.”
Catharsis, discussed elsewhere in this volume, is the biggest emotional and physical trigger of them all. We may get it in small doses
from almost every drama or story we see, but the big catharsis, a
whole-body emotional and physical spasm that cleans out your entire
system of toxins or triggers a complete change of orientation, is pretty
rare. You wouldn’t want to go through that disruption every day, for
a catharsis usually means a radical reorganization of priorities and
belief systems. But it does still happen now and then, when the story
and the listener are lined up just right, and it’s the thing that makes
so many people want to go into show business and the arts. They’ve
felt it. In the presence of work that is beautiful and true, honest and
real, something smashes you like a hammer striking glass and allows
you to suddenly put your own experience into proper new perspective. You might have experienced that deep shudder of realization, a
moment of profound connection with your family, your country, your
humanity, with the divine, or the things you believe in. A story, once
in a great while, can touch us at the deepest level, giving us a new view
of the world or a new reason to live, perhaps when we are ready for
that particular story to speak its truth to us. No wonder some people
want to be artists and storytellers, to participate in that mystery, and
create the possibility of that experience for others.

QUESTIONS
. What sensations do you get in watching a powerful dramatic
experience or a moving performance by a singer or other artist?
. Think ofa story that you particularly enjoyed or that meant something to you. How did it affect the organs of your body?
. What symbols or tableaux are particularly moving or meaningful
to you? How would you describe your feelings so someone else
could experience what you felt?
. How has your body reacted to frightening or life-threatening
situations? Write a short story or short film script capturing this
experience.
. Watch a scary movie and observe how the filmmaker manipulates
your breathing with editing, suspense, musical rhythms, color, etc.
. What kind of scene stirs up the most emotion or the strongest physical reaction for you? Write a series of scenes aiming
to evoke specific emotional or physical reactions — to bring a
shiver down the back, to raise goose-bumps on the arms, to trigger tears or laughter.

TEEVIBES, MAN

“Those rules of old discovered, not devised,
Are nature still, but nature methodized.”
An Essay on Criticism, Alexander Pope, 1711
“Tt’s all about the vibes, man.” That’s how we used to talk and think
in the golden days of my youth. With our psychedelic vision we saw
that everything in the Universe was vibrating at different frequencies.
Everything we could see and hear was the result of vibrating waves
of light and sound and every object we could touch was the result of
packets of energy resonating at the subatomic level. Like the Beach
Boys, we'd say, “I’m picking up good vibrations” when the feeling in a
room was positive, and when the atmosphere turned uncomfortable
or hostile, we'd ask, “Did you feel the bad vibes in there?”
I still think it’s all about the vibes, especially when it comes to
stories. I have come to believe that stories are designed to alter the
vibrational rate of the viewer or reader. At every moment we are all
vibrating to different rhythms that express our genetic heritage, surrounding environment, passing moods, and life choices we have made.
Those vibrations can be changed, either by conscious intention or by
unconscious response to shifts in the environment, including being
engaged emotionally in a powerful story. Whether or not we are aware
439
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
of it, by entering into the world of a story, we invite a change in our
vibrational patterns.
Stories can calm and reassure us, leading to a more serene vibration, or they can whip up our emotions and increase vibrational
activity in parts of the body where we thrill to feelings of tension
and terror. Some stories do both. The best of them aim to fine-tune
our vibrations, encouraging us to feel more in synch with our world,
more in touch with our feelings and more aware of the higher possibilities of consciousness. By guiding us through some adjustments of
our vibrational field, a good story can open us up to becoming more
fully human.
THE CHAKRAS
This vibrational way of thinking overlaps with an ancient spiritual
tradition, the concept of chakras. From a Sanskrit word that means
wheel, circle, or ring, the chakras are said to be invisible energy centers distributed within the human body. According to theory, they
vibrate in different patterns, depending on the physical, emotional,
and spiritual health of the person.
My friends and I had studied the chakras as part of our spiritual quest in our post-college days, learning about them from an
impish Sikh palm reader, Mr. Singh Modi, who taught us how to
meditate, gave us our mantras and explained how the chakras worked.
He presented them with humor and affection as parts of our being
that we should get to know so we could encourage them to flourish
and be happy.
However, the chakras became more than theory to me when I
was working as a development executive in Hollywood. At the Monday morning meetings where the staff debated the merits of the scripts
wed read over the weekend, I found myself pointing to different parts
of my body to explain how a story had made me feel. Maybe it choked
up my throat with sympathy for a character in trouble, maybe it made
440
It’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
my heart swell at a character’s courage, maybe it made my stomach
tighten with suspense. The good ones affected me in more than one
place. One day I realized I was pointing at my chakras, and that something in the skill of the storyteller had reached out and made a subtle
change in my vibrational rate, as if targeting my chakras and the associated organs of my body.
I concluded that the chakra system might be useful for identifying emotional and spiritual targets within the minds and bodies of
the audience. In my own writing, I became more conscious of what
chakras I was trying to provoke or heal, and how I was trying to shift
the reader or viewer’s vibrational rates in those zones. I realized the
chakras might also be used as a map for the spiritual and emotional
development of characters, as the conflicts and challenges of a story
force them to confront areas where they are closed off or unconscious.
- Along with all the other things to consider when creating characters — observation of people we have known, psychological theories,
archetypes, models from literature and movies, our own imaginations
— the seven chakras give another avenue for considering character
strengths, weaknesses, and blockages, and showing how characters
grow and change.
The chakra concept has guided and inspired spiritual seekers for
centuries and is found in the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.
It is a vast subject with many complexities and local variants, but we
will stick to the widely accepted version which asserts there are seven
major centers of energy in the body, located at various points along
the spine. In theory there are hundreds of these energy centers distributed over the whole body, but there is broad agreement, especially in
Western spiritualism, that these seven are the most important, representing a step-by-step pathway to higher consciousness.
Ascending from tailbone to crown of the head, they are the root
chakra, creative chakra, power chakra, heart chakra, throat chakra,
third eye chakra, and crown chakra.
44]
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Imagine that your body has seven invisible centers of energy distributed along your spine, from your tailbone all the way up to the
crown of your head. If you could see and hear them, you might experience them as humming, glowing orbs of gently pulsing energy, like
radiant flowers, some partly closed like buds waiting to unfold, others open and blossoming with lotus-like petals. Each one is dedicated
to an important task associated with its zone of the body. Students
of this system say the chakras have affinities for specific colors, gemstones, geometric forms, foods, types of music, mantras, etc. and will
thrive in the presence of the sympathetic items. For example, the heart
chakra is supposed to be healed and supported by the vibrations of
the colors pink and green; by rose quartz and green stones like jade
and emerald; by green leafy vegetables like kale and spinach; by the
smells of mint, eucalyptus, and pine; by certain frequencies of sound;
and by the chanting of the mantra “Yam.”
According to tradition, the chakra centers are being fed by
a mysterious life force called prana. The aim of certain schools of
meditation is to stimulate this vital force, through mindfulness and
conscious control of the breathing, so that it rises up to activate each
of the chakras in turn, in a series of quantum jumps of increasingly
refined energy until the crown chakra at the top of the head is opened,
and the fortunate person experiences spiritual enlightenment. All the
chakras are then fully opened, in alignment, and working in harmony
with one another, grounded to the earth and connected to the heayens. The effect of many spiritual practices such as meditation, yoga,
fasting, and chanting is to heal, cleanse, harmonize, and align the
chakras for peak emotional and physical health.
For our purposes, the chakra system is simply a way of drawing
attention to the many levels of emotional and spiritual awareness that
we experience in our progress through life. The chakras are a way to
get you to think about how emotions are felt in the different parts of
the body. The image of the chakras as lotus blossoms might give you
442
Ir’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
some ideas about how our different emotional centers may be open or
closed; how they may be healthy, strong, and radiant or sickly, weak,
and dull. Qualities such as love, hope, and trust can blossom and
thrive or wither and die.
Following is an introduction to the seven chakras, with their theoretical positions in the body, areas of responsibility, and thoughts
about how they might be useful in crafting stories.
THE SEVEN MAJOR CHAKRAS
ROOT CHAKRA (MULADHARA)
Located at the base of the spine. When this chakra is open and flourishing, we feel grounded and comfortable, trusting the earth under
our feet. We have shelter, enough to eat, and all of our basic survival
needs are met.
When we are stressed, this chakra closes up protectively. It suffers
when survival is threatened, when we are hungry or homeless, when
the earth trembles, when war and unrest attack our sense of security.
A loss of trust and confidence can take a long time to heal. Some
adults whose security was jeopardized at an early age never feel safe,
even when all of their physical security needs are taken care of.
The root chakra is like the roots of a tree, connected to and fed
by the Earth’s energies. People can find themselves out of touch with
these natural sources of energy and sustenance, especially in our
technology-obsessed world, or they may take them for granted, not
realizing how fragile they are. Another way a person might be out
of order in this chakra is to ignore the rules of gravity and try to flit
through life, ungrounded, uncentered. Such a person is described as
flighty and might have to learn that what goes up must come down,
sometimes quite hard.
In our storytelling, we can make deliberate efforts to activate or
agitate the root chakra. We might begin, as many stories do, with an
attack on the hero’s sense of security, or we could begin by lulling the
443
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
audience and the story’s hero into feeling that the world is comforting
and supportive. We can invite our viewers to relax, and then disturb
those comforting assumptions, triggering tension and tightening at
the base of the spine as they experience the hero’s loss of security.
Hitchcock and the other masters of suspense knew how to
undermine assumptions of security about the most basic things,
like freedom and trust in the ground under our feet. Hitchcock’s
heroes (as in Vertigo and North by Northwest) may find themselves
literally in suspense, hanging by their fingernails in some high and
dangerous place. This insecurity is mirrored by their loss of trust
in the people around them, so they are in suspense both physically
and emotionally.
Horror movies aim their emotional arrows directly at the root
chakra by getting us to identify with characters whose assumptions
about their personal safety are severely challenged. Stephen King is
particularly skilled at turning ordinary things like dogs (Cujo) or
cars (Christine) into agents of evil intention. In many movies of the
haunted house genre, the house, a primal symbol of security and comfort, itself becomes a devouring monster that attacks the security of
the root chakra.
The Wizard of Oz begins with an attack on Dorothy’s root chakra.
A tornado rips her home away from the comforting surface of the
Earth and flings her and the house into the sky. Along the way, she has
to master the energy of other chakras, tapping her creativity, claiming
her power, opening her heart to the suffering of others, and finding
her voice to speak up against injustice. In the end, the root chakra
is brought back to stability with Dorothy’s recovery from her fever
dream and her embrace of the idea that “there’s no place like home.”
CREATIVE CHAKRA (SVADHISTHANA)
Located in the pelvis, at the roots of the sexual organs. It is also called
the sacral chakra because of its location near the sacrum. Resembling
444
Ir’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
Freud's concept of libido, this chakra is a gateway to creativity in all
its forms, including artistic expression and problem-solving, as well
as sexual energy.
Like all the chakras, the creative works best in harmony with
other chakras. Good stories can be made from the struggles between
the different drives each chakra represents, or it can be entertaining
and instructive to see a character learn to use two or more chakras in
cooperation. For example, a character whose first chakra security is
threatened might use the creative energy of the second chakra to gain
access to power, the territory of the third chakra. The throat chakra is a
natural ally of the creative, allowing an outlet for the creative impulse to
find public expression. The sexual aspect of the creative chakra reaches
its highest potential when channeled through the heart chakra.
When the creative chakra is closed or blocked, creativity and
self-expression may lie dormant like a seed, waiting for the right conditions to blossom, or, if frustrated for too long, become wilted like
a neglected plant. But creativity is a strong drive and when blocked
by one pathway, it may seek expression through other chakras. For
example, a person whose creativity is ignored or denied may let loose
with a surprising verbal outburst from the throat chakra to signal it
will not be thwarted anymore.
Stimulating the audience with sexually charged scenes and situations is an easy way to activate the sacral chakra’s creative energy, but
audiences may also find pleasure from intellectual stimulus, in the
form of puzzles to solve and philosophies to ponder. Filmmakers at
the level of Terrence Malick, Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick,
or Darren Aronofsky erect complex structures with multiple levels
of meaning. Audiences seem to enjoy being challenged to think a bit
about their entertainment. Creative problem-solving is one of the
skills fostered by this chakra.
Detective stories, mysteries, and thrillers offer a challenge to the
root chakra that gets our attention, but we find a pleasure in using the
445
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
creative chakra to work out the puzzle, especially if there is a little sizzle of sex in the mystery.
POWER CHAKRA (MANIPURA)
Located between the navel and the bottom of the sternum. ‘This
chakra is about identity and ego. It generates the power we need to
assert ourselves as unique human beings. In children the chakra is like
a flower bud that unfurls naturally as they begin to feel an independent identity around the age of two, but blossoms fully in adolescence,
as developing personalities test their limits and experiment with the
possibilities of power.
In the transition between childhood and adult life, the power
chakra may blast open with torrents of uncontrollable energy. Young
people don’t know what to do with all this restless, aimless, untamed,
power. The higher chakras that can help them channel the excess
power in healthy ways have not yet been awakened, and this can leave
them feeling helpless in the face of their own wild urges. Frustrated
power can seek an outlet in uncontrolled anger. The Spider-Man movies are essays on the taming of teenage energy, with Peter Parker’s
arachnid superpowers standing for the difficult-to-control impulses
of every adolescent.
When we suddenly lose our sense of power over our own destiny, we feel an accompanying sensation of sinking in the stomach
that coincides with the protective closing up of the power chakra.
A sudden shock of bad news or the witnessing of some catastrophe can bring on distressing physical symptoms in the area around
this chakra. The body responds to sudden trauma by shutting down
blood flow to all but essential life organs, and an emotional shock
can cause a person to become weak in the knees and abruptly collapse or faint.
If someone has been continually thwarted and denied access to
their own power over a long period, there may be unpleasant reactions.
446
Ir’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
Thwarted power, flowing like water, seeks an outlet and may manifest
in passive-aggressive behavior, hostility, sarcasm, or sudden explosive violence.
Learning how to control the raw power offered by this chakra is
a lifetime task for some people. Relationships can become arenas for
epic power struggles between nations, factions, members of a family, or partners in a marriage. Personalities who are focused solely on
power can be dangerous unless other chakras, especially the heart, are
awakened to balance the drive for control and domination.
HEART CHAKRA (ANAHATA)
Located in the center of the chest, at the level of the heart. The heart
is essential for life itself. We cannot operate or live for long without
a fully functioning heart muscle, pumping oxygen-rich blood to our
extremities. A blow to the heart could be a death blow. But the heart
has other symbolic roles to play, associated with our concepts of love
and courage.
In Western thinking, the heart is the organ that feels the joys and
pains of love, the place that swells with emotion when we think of the
loved one, where we feel the stab of jealousy, where we feel cold as a
stone when love has gone.
Though the heart may be where love is felt, the eyes are considered the pathway to the heart. As Joseph Campbell reminds us,
quoting the 12th-century poet Giraut de Bornelh, “So through the
eyes love attains the heart, for the eyes are the scouts of the heart,
and the eyes go reconnoitering for what it would please the heart to
have.” Especially in movies, we celebrate “love at first sight,” the idea
that love begins with the first glimpse of a special, destined someone,
often with a meaningful exchange of glances, flashing with complex
feelings, urges, and signals.
The exchange of gifts is another way to warm the heart chakra,
forming a channel that encourages friendship or love to flourish. In
447
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
movies, gifts can be an outward sign of the inner desire to connect.
In Hacksaw Ridge, the nurse who will become the hero’ girlfriend
and eventually, his wife, gives him the gift of a Bible which he carries
with him into hellish combat zones, always sustained by the physical
reminder of her love and support.
In The Wrestler, elaborate exchanges of gifts express the universal human desire for connection. The wrestler of the title desires to
make a connection to a daughter he has neglected for years and wins
the aid of a stripper who helps him pick out a suitable birthday gift
for his daughter. In gratitude, the wrestler gives the stripper a gift, an
action figure modeled on himself from his glory days, intended for
her young son and symbolizing his desire to connect with her and be
a family man. The gifts temporarily open doors to the heart chakra
and produce some memorable scenes as the wrestler struggles to make
a fitful bond with his estranged, wary daughter.
The heart is associated with bravery as well as love. The English
word “courage” comes from French and Latin words for heart. King
Richard “the Lionhearted” and the Scottish leader William Wallace or
“Braveheart” won their epithets because of exceptional courage. “Take
heart” is a way of saying “Have courage.” Many a battle has turned into
a disaster when the men of one side “lost heart” all at once because the
tide turned or a beloved leader was cut down.
Compassion is another aspect of the heart chakra. Having an
open heart means that you are sensitive to the sufferings of other
beings and can feel empathy with them, like Christ as depicted in
Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, who can only feel
compassion for the sufferings of mankind. Characters whose heart
chakras are tightly closed (Scrooge in A Christmas Carol or the
Grinch in The Grinch Who Stole Christmas) may experience a sudden, once-in-a-lifetime blossoming of compassion in response to the
calls of family and community.
448
It’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
THROAT CHAKRA (VISHUDDA)
Located in the throat at the level of the Adam’s apple, but close to the
spine. This chakra is said to facilitate various forms of self-expression,
and needs to be open in order to have good communication in a relationship. Those who want a career in singing, acting, or any activity
that requires verbal skill, such as selling, teaching, or practicing law,
must either be lucky enough to be born with a naturally open throat
chakra or they will have to apply effort to open the channel and finetune its vibrations for good results.
Although as a solitary writer you may not use your physical voice
each day, every writer has to “develop a voice” which means finding
your own unique way of expressing your ideas and giving your characters distinct voices through their dialogue.
Some writers do use their voices in their daily practice, reading
their own words aloud, some whispering the dialogue to themselves,
some shouting it. Whatever works!
There are many skills to master before one can harness the full
power of the throat chakra. People who are shy and soft-spoken may
have trouble being heard in this noisy world, so they might have to
open their throat chakras by going someplace where they won't bother
anyone to practice screaming at the top of their lungs until they get
comfortable with speaking up. Others may have good loud voices that
need to be modulated so they don’t sound too harsh. Once the throat
chakra is open for business, other skills are needed, including clear diction, breathing from the diaphragm, projecting the voice to the back
of the room, making eye contact with members of the audience and
other tricks of the speaking, singing, and acting trades.
An open throat chakra allows characters to speak their truth. Many
movies have been constructed around a critical moment where a character makes a breakthrough in communication (The Miracle Worker,
The King’s Speech) or where telling the truth of a story brings about
social change (All the President's Men, Spotlight, The Post). Shaw’s play

Pygmalion and the musical version, My Fair Lady, dramatize the fine
tuning of Eliza Doolittle’s throat chakra by a master who is able to bring
forth the great lady that always lived in her, but was unheard and unseen
because of her thick Cockney accent and shabby appearance.
The throat chakra may become temporarily constricted when we
“choke up” because we are overcome with emotion or can’t find the
words to express our turbulent feelings. It can be deeply moving to
watch a character struggle to speak when emotions have been bottled
up for a long time. One of the most heart-wrenching moments in the
entertainment of my childhood was at the very end of the run of the
popular children’s program Howdy Doody, when the eternally silent
clown Clarabell opened his throat chakra and finally found a voice to
croak out the last line of the show, “Goodbye, kids!”
THIRD EYE CHAKRA (AJNA)
Located between the eyebrows. According to spiritual tradition, an
invisible organ in the center of the forehead constitutes the “third
eye, capable of perceiving phenomena that can’t be detected with our
normal eyes and other organs of perception. Supposedly this third
eye can “see” into past and future, can detect the thoughts of others
(telepathy), can perceive personal auras and other invisible phenomena. Clairvoyants and psychics may be born with this chakra open
and ready to use, but for ordinary folks the third eye is closed most
of the time, opening only occasionally when we have a flash of intuition. In rare cases it can be opened suddenly by an emotional shock
or even a blow to the head.
Almost everyone has experienced those odd flashes of insight
or moments of precognition when we seem to know in advance that
something is about to happen, or we sense that something dramatic
has happened far away. These could be random coincidences, but students of the subtle body interpret precognition and distant viewing
as an opening of the third-eye chakra.
450
IT’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
Philosophers and mystics have attempted to associate the concept
of the third eye with a physical organ, the mysterious pineal gland,
located deep in the brain, attached to the spinal cord. Science tells
us that this organ, no bigger than a grain of rice, receives messages
from the eyes about daily cycles of light and darkness and produces
the hormone melatonin to regulate both daily and seasonal rhythms
of sleep and waking. The philosopher Descartes thought there was
something special about the pineal gland, believing it was the seat of
the soul and a mediator between brain and body, a tiny entity sitting
in the driver’s seat controlling the human organism. Just as our two
physical eyes send sensory signals to the pineal gland, some people
speculate that the third eye also transmits extrasensory perception to
be processed there.
The concept of a third eye is useful, if only for imagining that
there is some central place in the body where the work of psychic perception is done. In some spiritual traditions, students actively imagine
a third eye and focus their thoughts there in an effort to improve psychic abilities. Active imagination of all the chakras is a practice in a
number of spiritual disciplines.
Spiritual traditions say that few people experience a full opening of
the third eye, for good reason: it could be overwhelming. An unfiltered
bombardment of impressions from other beings and realities would certainly be disorienting, and it takes training and practice to learn how
to modulate and filter a ceaseless stream of extrasensory information.
The opening of the third eye need not be something supernatural. In a story, it could be expressed simply as developing insight or
learning to trust one’s intuition. It may be that people have to progress through the levels of development represented by the four lower
chakras, before they can be open to trusting their own instincts.
Movies often suggest that quite ordinary characters are experiencing third eye activity, as they exhibit flashes of insight (“Aha!”
moments), precognition (“I have a bad feeling about this”), telepathy
451
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
(“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”), and remote viewing (“I feel
a disturbance in the Force”).
Typically, these brief moments of psychic ability are not free,
but must be earned by some serious challenge, such as a brush with
death, an attack on the character’s security or happiness, a shock,
or a crushing defeat. The third eye effect often seems to come into
play immediately after a character has been through a Hero's Journey
ordeal. It is as if the universe is wired to reward us with greater sensitivity for having come close to danger without running away in fear.
In detective stories, the hero may have to be beaten up or kidnapped
and drugged before gaining insight into the solution of the mystery.
Witnessing third eye activity can trigger physical responses.
When we see something uncanny that doesn’t match our map of reality, the body reacts by sending shivers down the back or causing the
hair to stand on end. We say we get “goosebumps” when we experience
something eerie and apparently unnatural, such as psychic abilities
beyond the normal range.
CROWN CHAKRA (SAHASWARA)
Most rarefied of all the chakras is the crown chakra, visualized as
a many-petaled lotus blossom unfolding above the head. When
opened by intense spiritual practice or a moment of deep insight, a
fountain of divine grace is said to pour forth, showering the enlightened person with positive vibrations. Under these conditions the
aura is believed to extend above the head, exceeding the limits of
the physical body. All the chakras are then open and in alignment,
and the boundaries of individual ego are dissolved. The personal
consciousness makes a final quantum jump and becomes centered
on the divine source.
Some people experience but one or two brief moments of
awakening in this chakra during a lifetime, and only the greatest spiritual teachers have this chakra permanently open. However, almost
452
IT’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
everyone feels occasional moments of spirituality, connection with
the divine, or awe of forces greater and more powerful than anything
in the human and physical world. Movies are quite good at representing this state of mind.
In the presence of inspiring displays of nature, such as mighty
storms and waterfalls, gorgeous sunsets and moonrises, awe-inspiring
rainbows and cloud displays, we may experience physical sensations
similar to those triggered by third eye activity, such as a shiver down
the back or the goosebumps that are an instinctive, involuntary reaction to being near something out of the ordinary, something that
seems otherworldly or uncanny, something we can’t fully explain.
Music has the power to give us a taste of the sublime experience of the open crown chakra. Beethoven intended the climax of his
Ninth Symphony to evoke of the feeling of entering the divine presence. Church choirs, organ music, and rock and roll have the power
to simulate a transcendent, cosmic experience.
The radiant energy of an open crown chakra is often depicted in
the religious art of East and West as the familiar halo of light around
the heads of saints, angels, enlightened beings like Buddha, and the
Trinity of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. A glowing halo in
a painting or on a statue of a saint is a sign that the subject has been
enlightened and has developed a highly refined channel for communication with the divine.
The halo concept also lies behind the idea of bejeweled golden
crowns adorning the heads of kings, queens, and nobles. The golden
crown, a physical representation of the crown chakra’s radiant energy,
is meant to indicate that the wearer has been blessed by God and is to
be regarded as God’s representative on earth, and therefore automatically enlightened by virtue of his or her supposedly semi-divine status.
Movies generally aim to stimulate the lower chakras, appealing
to our need for security, our drives for sex and creativity, our urge for
power, our yearning for love, our need to be heard and understood.
453
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
But occasionally our entertainment can reach into the highest realms
of human potential and give us a taste of the sublime. Movies have
always used their power of convincing illusion to induce exalted states
of mind, beginning with religious pageants such as The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur and continuing today with high-energy
religiously based entertainments like The Passion of the Christ and
Aronofsky’s Noah. The powerful special effects now available to artists are ideally suited to replicating spiritual experiences, putting on
light and sound shows comparable to those the human mind generates in states of ecstasy or spiritual bliss. 2001: A Space Odyssey uses
special effects and eerie music to replicate an intense psychological
event, where contact with an advanced alien race might as well be a
reality-changing confrontation with gods or angels. Science fiction
films like Contact, Interstellar, and Prometheus invite us to experience simulations of exalted states of mind. The TV series Enlightened
examined what happens when a person who has achieved a spiritual breakthrough and a full opening of her chakras tries to return to
normal life.
The crown chakra is one of those notes on the keyboard that you
will probably play rarely, but it can be a powerful experience for an
audience to witness a character’s moment of sublime transcendence
or being in the presence of gods.
APPLYING THE CHAKRA CONCEPT
TO YOUR STORIES
Now that you've had a brief tour of the seven chakras, how can you
work with them to tell better stories?
The chakra system can be viewed as a ladder of increasingly refined
forms of energy, roughly corresponding with the Hero’s Journey. The
root chakra is expressed in every hero’s relationship with an Ordinary
World. Heroes might encounter Calls, Refusals, and Mentors in opening up the chakras of creativity and power. There is a definite Threshold
454
IT’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
in the chakra system, as heroes make the leap to the higher vibrations of
the heart chakra, where there may be elaborate dances of Approach and
dramatic Ordeals. The opening of the throat chakra often corresponds
with the Reward phase, as heroes find the courage to speak their truth,
and there may be evidence of third eye chakra activity as heroes gain
greater insight on the Road Back. The powers of all the chakras may be
called upon in the climax of the Resurrection stage, and the afterglow
of a Return with the Elixir can give a glimpse of the crown chakra in
flower. The Hero's Journey in myth and literature aspires to activate and
harmonize all of the chakras on the way to the full enlightenment and
expanded consciousness represented by the opened crown chakra, so
that we become what Joseph Campbell called “Master of Two Worlds”:
returning to ordinary life but profoundly transformed by an encounter
with something transcendent.
The transformation of the hero may be accomplished by a simple
clearing of blocked energy in one or more chakras, or by the ascent
from lower chakras to higher ones, or by the connecting up of chakras
that have been long out of touch.
Of course, it is possible to aim directly at the lower chakras for
the sake of physical horror, sexual excitement, or indulgence in fantasies of power. Many successful movies and franchises have been built
around appealing only to these centers, with no saving grace of love,
self-expression, spiritual insight, or enlightenment.
You might think of the chakras as targets for your emotional
arrows. You can aim high or aim low, but you should be conscious and
intentional about the effects you are trying to achieve. Think about
a story that affected you deeply. What chakra were the artists aiming
at? In what parts of your body (which chakras) did you feel the emotions? How did the storytellers show how the characters were blocked
in some chakras and opening up in others?
Think about your own story and what chakras you are aiming at.
How can you invite your audience to experience the opening up of
455
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
those centers: to share a character's self-empowerment as the power
chakra opens, to feel the pangs and joys of love through the heart
chakra, to want to burst into song or cry out one’s truth through the
throat chakra?
The chakra concept suggests that our consciousness is divided
up among these seven centers, and that each chakra is almost a subpersonality within the whole person. Therefore, it is possible to live
one’s life primarily through one chakra, with the others assuming
lesser roles in one’s psychological hierarchy. It could be that the dramatic matter of a story is the reassessment of that hierarchy under
pressure, and the reassigning of priorities to put more emphasis on
the neglected areas. Or, in the tragic mode, you could depict the
failure to restructure the hierarchy. The character of Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane sought expression all his life only through
the power chakra and the creative chakra, and only when it was too
late did he acknowledge that what he really craved was comfort in
the heart chakra.
Like members of a family, sometimes the chakras fight each other,
struggle for power, and turn their backs on one another. But they can
learn to work together in a way that benefits the whole organism.
Your job, as storyteller, is to weave the audience’s randomly, chaotically vibrating emotions into the conscious, intentional web of your
story, so that they experience a distinct change in their vibrational rate
and their state of consciousness. This shift is triggered by witnessing
the emotional challenges of your characters, whose vibrational rates
are also changing as they struggle against opposition and learn more
about themselves.
When you tell a story, the audience should feel differently at the
end. They should be aware on some level that their vibrational rate
has changed. In rare cases a work of art can deliver a shattering, lifechanging reorientation; more often, it gives us a little “Aha!” moment
of insight into life or our own condition. Joseph Campbell spoke of
456
Ir’s ALL ABOUT THE VIBES, MAN
“an amplification of consciousness such as one might experience in
ascending from one level to the next in Japanese temple garden... you
are climbing up and suddenly a whole new vista opens. It’s arranged
so that you get an amplification of consciousness just by experiencing that garden.” (The Hero’ Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and
Work, by Joseph Campbell & Phil Cousineau, 1990, p. 150)
You, at this moment, are vibrating on many levels, but in a way
unique to you, the sum total of your environment, your heredity,
and your life choices up to this moment. That vibrational rate can
be changed. The chakra system points to the possibility that you can
consciously set out to improve your vibrational rate, and live in your
world with more harmony, ease of movement, and access to all the
possibilities of your mind and body.
From the point of view of telling stories, the chakra system is just
another tool to analyze characters and think about how they change.
Pay attention to your body next time you see a movie that stirs your
emotions. Maybe your chakras are trying to tell you something.
And don’t forget: It’s all about the vibes.
QUESTIONS
1. Think of a movie or story you enjoyed. What chakras were the
storytellers aiming at? Did the characters experience the opening
of certain chakras?
2. If you had any feelings while watching or reading a story, where in
your body did you feel them? Describe those sensations.
3. How do storytellers represent shifts in consciousness: moments
of realization, insight, intuition, emotional development, spiritual
growth? How do they represent blockages in someone's character development?
4, Write a short story about a moment when you felt your physical
survival (root chakra) was threatened. Did you feel that the power
of any other chakra came to your aid in that incident?

‘In the midst of life's journey I found myself in
a dark wood, for the right path was lost.”
o said Dante at the beginning of the Inferno
and so I found myself at a certain passage in the
journey of my life, hiking alone in the forest
near Big Sur, California. I was in a dark wood,
all right, and lost. I was cold, hungry, shivering,
exhausted, and panicked by the thought of night closing in.
It had been a rainy winter, with storm after storm saturating the
hillsides after years of drought. I felt pounded by heavy weather in
my own life, and had come north to the sacred country of Big Sur to
find some things I had lost: solitude, peace of mind, clarity. I felt I had
failed in important areas of jobs and relationships and was confused
about which way to move next. I had some decisions to make about
my direction and knew instinctively that a plunge into the wilderness could give me a vision of the future to lead me out of my present
confusion.
As I set out on the well-marked Forest Service trail that winds
into the wild canyons of Big Sur, I noted a little sign that warned the
46]
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
trail was rough in spots. I expected the path to be wet and muddy in
places because of the recent rains, but quickly found out I had underestimated the ferocious impact of the winter storms on the fragile
hillsides. The whole mountain range was a vast sponge that was now
draining slowly into the canyons, unimaginable amounts of water
carving new canyons and streams. Time and again I rounded a corner to find that the trail ahead simply vanished for fifty yards because
a whole hillside had washed away, trail and all, leaving a damp scar
of crumbling shale and a waterfall cascading down the raw rock. The
freshly exposed rock is easily broken into shards called scree that flow
downhill almost as easily as water, and can be as treacherous as quicksand. I could see the trail continuing again beyond the stretch where
the hillside had collapsed, and had no choice but to scramble like a
crab across the shifting, slippery rock face, clinging by fingertips and
toes, digging into the tumbling scree until I was back on the level surface of the broken path. It continued for a few hundred feet around
a shoulder of the mountain, only to disappear again in another mudslide that had to be crossed by the finger-and-toe method.
At first this seemed exhilarating, just the kind of minor wilderness challenge that I was after. But after the third or fourth time of
edging out across a sheer, unstable cliff face with muddy water streaming over me, the process began to take its toll. My arms and legs began
to tremble from the unaccustomed exertion, my fingers and toes grew
cramped. My core temperature dropped from repeated soakings as
the cool air chilled my clothes and skin by evaporation. At times the
whole hillside of yellow mud and shale seemed to be shuddering and
slipping under me, flowing in a slow-motion mudslide. By the tenth
crossing I was starting to get worried. The hike that was supposed to
take an hour had taken three hours and there was no end in sight.
I lost my footing a couple of times in the muck and barely caught
myself, clinging to the crumbling rock with fingers cramped and arms
462
TRUST THE PATH
shaking, knowing I would fall for hundreds of feet before I hit something solid and level.
And then, as my adventure led me around the cooler, shadow
side of the mountain, I reached a vast, wet scar where a whole slab of
the mountain had fallen away into a deep canyon, leaving a slanted
field of jagged boulders the size of houses that would be challenging
to cross. I didn’t know whether to turn back or keep going. I began to
measure my strength very precisely, recognizing a primal, instinctive
hyper-awareness that comes when one is at the edge of death. For as I
watched the sun sink into the tree-line, I felt my life energy draining,
and realized I was in one of those classic California wilderness tragedy situations that you read about in the newspapers. Some fool gets
himself stuck in the woods at night and falls into a canyon and breaks
his neck or wanders lost for days until he starves to death. It happens
all the time. Was this my turn?
With my heightened awareness I knew almost to the calorie how
much energy was left in my body. I had brought little food with me,
just a handful of trail mix, and had consumed that long ago, observing how the nuts and raisins instantly charged me with energy, only
to send me crashing a few minutes later when | had burned them off
in scrambling across the treacherous shale. How thin, the margin that
preserves life. I knew that every step from now on was drawing on core
reserves. I could almost see the sands in the hourglass of my life rushing inevitably down to nothing.
The question was whether to turn back or go ahead. The way
ahead was uncertain. I couldn’t see the trail picking up on the other
side of the landslip and I knew it would be a difficult task to cross the
rugged face of the scar, which was the only way to continue. It would
take as much energy as I had already expended, maybe more, and
there was no assurance that I would be able to find the trail again in
the trees on the other side. I might just be plunging deeper into the
wilderness with night coming on.
463
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
I thought about turning back and re-tracing the broken trail I
had just traversed with such difficulty, but I knew with a terrible certainty that if I tried that, I would die. My hands were cramping up like
claws and would be almost useless. My arms and legs were shaking and
I was absolutely sure that I would fall if I tried to go back across three
or four more of those muddy vertical rock faces, especially in the dark.
So I gathered my strength and continued on across the field of
boulders, crawling like an ant, an insignificant dot on the flank of
a mountain. I was impressed by the immense forces that had raised
these rocks thousands of feet into the sky in the first place and now
had torn down the mountainside. I finally made it across into the
trees, winded, cold, and feeling at the end of my strength, but now
there was a different problem. Where was the trail? There was no sign
of it. Vague paths seemed to lead me deeper into darkness, into brambles, into impenetrable cool thickets like those surrounding cursed
castles in fairy tales. I stumbled up and down the mountainside, my
face and hands scratched by branches, hoping to intersect with the
true path, but getting more and more hopelessly lost and frantic as
night crept near. I had to get out of there. I knew it was a very bad idea
to attempt to spend the night in the forest, unprepared. People die of
exposure out here all the time. I noticed for the first time that air on a
mountain flows at different times of day like a mass of water. Cold air
seemed to be rushing downhill all around me, flooding the bottomless canyon and chilling my blood, dragging my spirits further down.
I dread that word “lost” and tried to deny it to myself, but I had
to admit it. A whole host of unfamiliar sensations and thoughts came
over me as I watched the shadows of the black trees march down the
canyons. My heart pounded, my hands shook. The forest seemed to
be speaking to me, pleading with me, calling to me. “Come,” it said
in a witch’s voice of a million leaves rasping together. “Here is an easy
end to your pain. Join us! Jump! Take a run and launch yourself off
this cliff into this canyon. It will all be over in an instant. We'll take
464
TRUST THE PaTH
care of everything.” And oddly enough, that plea sounded appealing
and reasonable to some part of me, the part that was terrified, the part
that just wanted this awful moment to be over.
But another sliver of my brain stepped back, and recognized that
I was experiencing the common human psychological state known as
panic. The Greeks, with their talent for naming things, called it panic
because they believed it was a visit from the nature god Pan, goatfooted, flute-playing Pan, who can inspire mortals but also has the
power to terrify them, overwhelming their senses with the awesome
forces at his command, causing them to do foolish things and die.
I felt the presence too of the witches from the old European and
Russian folktales, fearsome figures who represent the dual nature of
the primeval forest. The heroes of those tales learn that the witches,
like the forest, can quickly break, destroy, and consume you, but, if
you learn how to appease and honor them, they can also support and
protect you like a kindly grandmother, hiding you from enemies and
providing you food and shelter. At the moment, the forest was turning
its nastiest and most seductive witchy face to me. There was something
alive and evil and hungry out there, like the witch in “Hansel and
Gretel” but stretched out over the whole forest. I was in big trouble.
I stopped and took a breath. That simple act brought a sudden
surge of clarity and common sense to my panicked brain that was
causing me to rush about like a terrified animal. I realized I had not
been breathing properly, that my gasping and panting had deprived
my brain of oxygen. Together with my exhaustion and the sudden
chill, I was in a mild state of shock, blood rushing away from the head
and extremities to preserve a core of life force and heat. I took a few
deep breaths and could feel blood returning to my skull.
Instead of thrashing around pointlessly, I took in my surroundings and got in touch with something ancient and instinctive in me,
a reliable inner sense of what to do in dangerous situations.
465
THE WRITER’S JOURNEY
Christopher Vogler
Just then, a voice came into my head, clear as sunlight. “Trust the
path, it said. I truly heard this, as a spoken sentence that seemed to
be coming from a deep part of me. But I smiled, scoffing at the idea.
That’s the problem, I said to myself. There is no path. I trusted the Forest Service trail and look where it got me. I’ve been looking for the
path for half an hour and it’s just not here. And in the larger sense, in
the big picture of my life, over a period of years, I had also lost sight
of the true way.
“Trust the path,” said the voice again, patient and true. In that
voice was a certainty that there must be a path, and that it could be
relied upon to do its job.
I looked down and saw a little groove in the weeds — an ant trail.
There, oblivious to my panic, ants were going about their tiny business in an endless column. With my eyes I followed the ant trail, the
only path I could see.
It led me to a slightly deeper groove in the underbrush, a little
trail used by field mice and other small creatures, almost a tunnel
through the brambles. And soon that guided me to a broader path, a
zigzagging deer trail that climbed the mountainside in easy stages. I
started putting one foot in front of the other, following that trail. It
led me out of the labyrinth, like Ariadne’s thread leading Theseus out
of the maze. In a few steps I came to a clearing, a mountain meadow
were the sun was still shining. Across the meadow I found a wellmaintained trail and realized I was back on an official Forest Service
path, the right road, the way back.
As I walked along, calmer now, the way out of my personal confusion became clearer. “Trust the path,” my voice had said, and I took
that to mean “Keep marching ahead to the next stage of life. Don’t
try to go backwards, don’t allow yourself to get paralyzed or panicked,
just keep marching. Trust that your instincts are good and natural and
will lead you to a happier, safer place.” Then the hiking trail merged
with a fire road, wide as two fire trucks, and in half an hour I was back
TRUST THE PATH
on the highway where my blessed Volkswagen was parked. The sun
was still blazing on the Western horizon, though I knew back in those
canyons it was already deepest night, and I could have died there.
As I looked back at the mountains and forest that had just held
me in their jaws, I realized I’d been given a gift with that phrase, Trust
the Path, and I pass it on to you. It means that when you are lost
and confused, you can trust the journey that you have chosen, or
that has chosen you. It means others have been on the journey before
you, the writer's journey, the storyteller’s journey. You're not the first,
youre not the last. Your experience of it is unique, your viewpoint
has value, but you're also part of something, a long tradition that
stretches back to the very beginnings of our race. The journey has its
own wisdom, the story knows the way. Trust the journey. Trust the
story. Trust the path.
As Dante says, at the beginning of the Inferno, “In the midst of
life’s journey I found myself in a dark wood, for the right path was
lost.” I think we're all doing that, in our various ways, finding ourselves
through the journey of our writing lives. Looking for our Selves in the
dark wood. I wish you luck and adventure and I hope you find yourself on your journey. Bon voyage.

MEMO FROM THE STORY DEPT.: SECRETS OF STRUCTURE AND CHARACTER
CHRISTOPHER VOGLER, DAVID MCKENNA
Memo From the Story Dept. offers a battery of storygenerating engines
and storyimproving tools, and reliable methods tested on hundreds
of Hollywood productions. It goes far beyond the standard advice
given in most screenwriting manuals. Drawn from sources as varied
as vaudeville, classical Greek comedies, and Russian fairy tales, the
book outlines a series of practical templates for creating believable
characters and emotionally satisfying plots.
“The way that Vogler and McKenna tag-team this book — it keeps you
on your toes. Sometimes when you're yelling in the wilderness, it’s
good to have two voices. Certainly they'll give you perspectives on screenwriting that you've never
seen before — and in this world of multiple screenwriting book choices, that’s a good thing.”
—Matthew Terry, filmmaker/screenwriter/teacher, columnist for www.hollywoodlitsales.com
“Story structure is 90% of the game in screenwriting, though it’s invisible on the page. Great movies
have great structure — period. Nobody understands that better, and communicates it more brilliantly,
than Mr. McKenna. His insight is a key reason I'm a working writer today.”
— Mark Fergus, Oscar-nominated co-screenwriter, Children of Men and Iron Man
“Make no mistake: this book is completely inaccurate. Why? Because no story department has ever
given notes this good. This book is such a wonderful walk through story, theme, and character that
every writer — and development exec — should keep a copy on their desk.”
—Chad Gervich, writer/producer (Wipeout, Reality Binge, Speeders, Foody Call), author of Small
Screen, Big Picture: A Writer's Guide to the TV Business
“Just finished reading Memo from the Story Dept. (so / could write this blurb) and it’s already saved
my ass. | needed to come up with a pitch for a rewrite and this book helped me figure out a way to
crack it. No shit.”
—Scott Silver, screenwriter (8 Mile, Oscar-nominated for The Fighter)

In a dark time, a light bringer came along, leading the curious and the frustrated to
clarity and empowerment. It took the well-guarded secrets out of the hands of the few
and made them available to all. It spread a spirit of openness and creative freedom,
and built a storehouse of knowledge dedicated to the betterment of the arts.
The essence of the Michael Wiese Productions (MWP) is empowering people who have
the burning desire to express themselves creatively. We help them realize their dreams
by putting the tools in their hands. We demystify the sometimes secretive worlds of
screenwriting, directing, acting, producing, film financing, and other media crafts.
By doing so, we hope to bring forth a realization of ‘conscious media’ which we define
as being positively charged, emphasizing hope and affirming positive values like trust,
cooperation, self-empowerment, freedom, and love. Grounded in the deep roots of
myth, it aims to be healing both for those who make the art and those who encounter
it. It hopes to be transformative for people, opening doors to new possibilities and
pulling back veils to reveal hidden worlds.
MWP has built a storehouse of knowledge unequaled in the world, for no other
publisher has so many titles on the media arts. Please visit www.mwp.com where

model used by mythologists, storytellers, and filmmakers. A production
chief was so impressed, he immediately hired Vogler as a story analyst on
The Lion King!
This 25th Anniversary revised edition includes new sections and topics,
with material addressing the screenwriter's contract with the audience,
the relationship of chakras to storytelling, and power transactions
. within scenes.
‘A veritable gift from the screenwriting gods... indispensable.”
—Jason Fuchs, cowriter, Wonder Woman
‘A classic full of insight and inspiration... a must-read.”
— Richard D. Zanuck, producer, Driving Miss Daisy
“Every time I start a project I re-skim The Writer's Journey!”
— Jason Segel, actor, Forgetting Sarah Marshall
